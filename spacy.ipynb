       "'their eggplant parm is terrible. eggplant wasn\\'t cooked right so it was chewy disgusting. greek caesar salad looked great except lettuce all wilted cause they didn\\'t refrigerate. too many other places to go before revisiting, just had this pizza for the first time, and i\\'d say it is some of the worst i\\'ve eaten. it reminds me of cafeteria pizza. i\\'m sticking with felicia\\'s pizza around the corner., i ordered take-out...and i regreted quickly! i ordered online and not in store so perhaps that  was a huge mistake. i like carmelized onions and roasted eggplant on my pizza - what i\\'ve got was about 3 pounds of eggplant parmegiana on top of my pizza instead. the pizza was 3\" high. way too much stuff which left the dough gooey and raw! \\nnever again!, we ordered a delivery online through eat street, ardmore pizza confirmed the order online, we received the confirmation email, but the food did not come. we called and they lied about receiving the order, and did nothing to help other than sounding defensive. we just drove 7 hours from our wedding, and we are very disappointed at their service. we will never order from them again., the cheesesteak i ordered was quite meaty and had my requested mushrooms, ketchup and mayo, the sandwich arrived cold and had broken through the bottom of the roll. i didn\\'t ask for siracha but it somehow made it on to my cheesesteak making my dog the happiest dog ever with the hungriest owner ever. even though ardmore pizza has high ratings, i might order take out from some where a little closer by., i ordered a cheesesteak for lunch. the bread sucked, the meat had bone chips in it (almost cracked a tooth), and overall the flavor was lacking. i picked up and the order totaled $18 for a plain cheesesteak and a small plain pizza. this may be the worst option in the area., i\\'ve had food from here 3 times now and have been disappointed every time. my most recent experience included a mcdonald\\'s type nugget soaked in buffalo sauce. i know that still counts as a \"buffalo nugget\" but it really wasn\\'t what i expected. (and they certainly not for 9 dollars) also, my fries were soggy and wet... my only recommendation is to find another pizza shop!, i can\\'t believe i ordered from them again and once more i regret. \\nwill keep it super short this time. \\nordered two pizzas one plain one white with onions. i\\'ve got two pain instead - one with onion. they did get part of it right!!!\\ngrease!!!!!!!!!!!!grease!!!!!!!!!!!grease!!!!!!!!!!!! and hell lots of salt!!!!!!!! never again !!!!!!!!! even if that was the last pizza on planet !, eh use to be good wish they hadn\\'t changed but what can you do? i\\'ll give them some time and see if they change back, this was a 5 star pizza place for years but in 2018 they changed something. seemed like the owners wanted to get more involved but since then it\\'s been getting worse by the week. tonight i wanted wings and so ordered ardmore, spent 30 dollars on wings and more. they brought everything but the wings. driver offered me a 5 dollar bill as reimbursement when the wings were more than 5 before tax. extremely disappointed as a previously loyal customer. \\n\\ngo back to how it was a year ago, whoever\\'s in charge now is ruining what used to be my favorite pizza place., so i\\'ve called before to inform management that there are frequently many boxes from their restaurant in the parking lot of my apartment buildings. (due to the fact that the back of their building is right next to my parking lot) i often have to gather the boxes myself and move them to the dumpster to avoid damage to my car and others. \\ni\\'ve noticed this issue occurs because instead of putting their empty boxes straight into their dumpster, they throw them out the back door until someone decides to get around to it. and by then they\\'ve probably lost 10 or more boxes that are now scattering about with the wind in ardmore. thanks for polluting our neighborhood ardmore pizza., this place is literally the worst customer service. they messed up my order then were very rude telling me it was my fault for not checking before the delivery guy left.... which i did and he told me to call! so glad they are a-holes and rude since it helped me find way better  places to eat. ardmore pizza, just another mediocre pizza shop except rude employees. pass., ordered a large 1-topping pie and it was about the size and quality of a digiorno frozen pizza.  dense, doughy crust, not enough sauce, generally unenjoyable even though i was starving and excited for pizza.  $20 with tip from an unfriendly delivery guy., received confirmation of my order at 5 pm, charged, and by 7 pm still no delivery. dealing with some very hungry, upset kids, we\\'ve stopped going to ardmore pizza altogether. we don\\'t know if there was a management change or what, but the quality of everything has gone steadily downhill over the 4 years we\\'ve been ordering here. the burgers that used to be so delicious are now dense bricks that are less flavorful, the cheesesteaks once packed with meat are now scrimpy, and the pizza was just meh; the fries are still good, though. we\\'re disappointed because we liked this little shop so much and prefer non-chain shops, but it\\'s not worth the cost and the disappointment to try again., i hate to agree but the new owners have made this place sub par! won\\'t be ordering again and will give sun valley my money, the pizza is fine but their new app to order it is terrible. apps are supposed to make things easy. their new app makes it impossible to simply order a pizza. when i finally got to the order screen there were a total of four extra fees. no thanks., we got a cheese pizza and a calzone last night. what has happened to ardmore pizza?!!  it was terrible. a small pizza is now equal to a personal pizza anywhere else. the calzone was made with hoagie ingredients. i got a piece with nothing but three full round to tomato slices, not cheese nothing else. my next slice was three huge pieces of green peppers and a huge mound of ricotta cheese nothing else. the ingredients were huge and lumped together. if you got one ingredient on this slice you got all that was on the calzone. the put a lump here a lump there and another lump over there.  the worst calzone i have ever had. the small cheese pizza was no better. my kids wouldn\\'t even eat it because how burnt it was. never again!  i\\'m done with them. they were great for years but we live in a pizza mecca. why order junk when there is great pizza on every block., placed a delivery order on a saying night, very understanding that it is a busy night and not expecting it to arrive immediately. when we did receive our pizza we received a reheated frozen pizza! we have ordered from them before and we know what their pizza looks like and this was not it ! was not even able to eat the pizza because it was so awful., the manager refuses to wear a mask. shows no concern for co-workers or patrons. some other workers were not wearing masks either. co-workers didn\\'t seem worried while standing right next to him. perhaps they are afraid they\\'ll lose their job.\\ncustomers beware., ordered a chicken parmigiana sandwich.  they asked if provolone was ok.  the cook and most of the staff had masks around their necks but where not really wearing them.  the overall condition of the restaurant was dingy and the sandwich was not great., went here and don\\'t think i will come back. pizza was not authentic, very small pie and the cheese tasted tangy. \\n\\nthis pizza is very comparable the frozen 365 pizza you can find at whole foods. the shape and taste are identical., this was the first time i ordered from this place. i ordered a small specialty pizza and a regular cheesesteak. the cheesesteak was very mediocre, and they delivered the wrong pizza. when i called and asked them to make it right, they offered to bring a new pizza or to take $5 off the bill. i told them that i\\'d like for them to remove the pizza\\'s charge from the bill - they were unwilling. perhaps i was nitpicking here, but nevertheless i did not have a positive experience, either with the taste of the food or with the customer service., ordered a pepperoni pizza, buffalo chicken cheesesteak and mozzarella sticks. the order took over a hour to deliver on a sunday. also the pizza was burnt an greasy to the point that a refund should be in order. the buffalo chicken cheesesteak had blue cheese pieces in it which isn\\'t correct an came undercooked. the mozzarella sticks weren\\'t cooked, just thawed from the freezer. the food was horrible i\\'d recommend never ordering here. \\nbravo in havertown makes better food an is cleaner overall, i ordered pizza on a friday night, so i wasn\\'t surprised that the wait for delivery was an hour. when the pizza was 30 minutes late, i called to find out how much longer and was assured it was on its way. about 15-20 minutes later, the pizza showed up. the delivery guy apologized profusely. i assumed that the shop had been slammed and my pizza was just late getting out the door. but based on how cold it was, that wasn\\'t the (only?) case. \\n\\npizza flavor was slightly better than just okay. crust was better than most that i\\'ve had since we moved here two years ago. we may try them again to see how good it is when it\\'s fresh and hot, but not anytime soon., until last night i didn\\'t realize you could fumble pizza this badly. \\nthe pizza was bad. not sure if it\\'s an ingredient issue but this is the first time i couldn\\'t finish a small pizza on an empty stomach. also my order was incomplete. so i paid for items not provided :/. lesson learned. sorry i absolutely do not recommend the place., unimpressive overly-americanized greasy pizza that resembles national chain pizza such as pizza hut. the place\\'s most redeeming quality other than late convenient hours is that it is better than marrones up the street (a one star pizza). you\\'re much better off going to felicia\\'s brick oven pizza a few doors down in the party city parking lot and paying the extra $2 for much better quality authentic pizza made by a real italian. (or $5 more for the pomodoro, their #1), ardmore pizza is usually our go-to place for cheesesteaks, burgers, and fries.  the food is consistently good; which is why my experience tonight is so disappointing.\\n\\ni ordered a large fries and an order of clam strips.  their fries are usually so amazing that i won\\'t pass them up.  crispy on the outside, creamy in the middle.  they are french fry heaven.  i\\'d been thinking of branching out and trying something different, so i ordered the clam strips which were on the appetizer menu.\\n\\nwhen i placed the order, the man at the counter asked me if they were the appetizers and i said yes.  he told me he\\'d ring it up as a platter and that would save me a little money.\\n\\nand that was my mistake.  i should have said, \"no thanks,\" because that platter didn\\'t save me any money at all.\\n\\ni live a short 5 min from the store.  when i got home, i opened the container to find the fries sitting on top of a salad.  let\\'s forget that i didn\\'t order salad.  salads are cold.  french fries are hot.  dumping hot fries on a cold salad does what to those two foods?  it turns the salad into slimy, limp, warm slop.  it also made their normally crispy fries wet and limp.\\n\\nas if that weren\\'t bad enough, the clam strips weren\\'t strips. they looked like overcooked little balls and they were all over the fries and the salad.  all of this was in a styrofoam container that was all wet inside from the steam build up.\\n\\nthat entire box was $9.25 + tax of inedible crap and went right in the trash.  \\n\\nfine.  lesson learned.  next time i want fries, i\\'ll order from the appetizer menu.  and i\\'ll pass on the clam \"strips\" and stick with the two items i know are fantastic: the cheesesteaks and the burgers.\\n\\n(for the record, i\\'m not new to \"platters.\"  what\\'s different here is the fact that the cold salad was in with hot food. platters i\\'ve ordered elsewhere include salads in their own containers. this is restaurant basics 101:  serve the cold food cold and the hot food hot.), this place is all hype. also i was denied entrance because i was accompanied by my service dog (with proper ada documentation) and the manager told me i couldn\\'t come in with a \"pet\"., this review is specific to the kid area, which to me is like the main attraction of the place. the kid area is basically a bar and hodgepodge of kid related things - a large pirate ship playground, some games like skeeball and foosball, some nintendos, and other stuff like, i guess, mummers costumes and an old phone booth. first off, the layout is not great -- you can\\'t see most of the play area from the seats and the hidden area is right next to double doors to outside. also, they just opened and many of the games don\\'t work, are missing their balls, or won\\'t turn on. in addition, the menu is pricy and the drinks and food were underwhelming. for example, we ordered a bloody mary, which was $10, and just included tito\\'s vodka, bloody mary mix, and a lemon wedge. it is advertised as coming with stateside vodka, but whatever. just underwhelming. my main feeling about this place is it is a good idea but meh execution. it\\'s the type of place you go and think, i could do this so much better., what a disappointment. as a parent with young kids in the neighborhood, i heard so much excitement about this place. it was not good. service was awful- slow and indifferent.  they lost our order, resulting in cranky hungry kids. then, they got the order wrong. food was overpriced and mediocre. worst of all, the play area (basically the whole point of coming, for us) was poorly thought out. it\\'s a big wooden structure that you can\\'t see many parts of from where you\\'re sitting and eating. so it\\'s not like you can sit and relax while eating and drinking and still keeping an eye on your kids. you have to keep getting up and looking for them. also, there\\'s a bunch of other random stuff in the play area that is broken or not appropriate for young kids - like a foosball table with handles right at 3-year-old eye poking level.  yeah, i won\\'t be back., no stars. refused to let my service dog in yesterday. rude welcome. why won\\'t this establishment follow laws and not ruin my family get together??? do not support this restaurant., this place is a joke. we had an abysmal experience because of the \"management\".  our party of 8 had come together because of a death in our family and were were treated horribly.  the manager, gestapo, führer, whatever you want to call her is clearly on a massive power trip and feels that covid has made her more important than she will ever be.  we came in the door and asked for a table.  she proceeded make us wait an inordinate amount of time while she stared at her ipad as if trying to find us a table in an establishment with only 4 occupied tables.   she then rattled off the mask rules in a condescending and insulting tone and when we asked for clarification of her less than standard rules, she abruptly shut me up and held up her hand to stop me from speaking.  we were taken to our table which was a picnic bench style and outside.   there were 6 in our party and we were expecting 2 more.  when we got to our outside table, we took 2 chairs from a nearby empty table in order to accommodate our party.  our server told us that the rude, power hungry manager said we can\\'t use those chairs because the table was reserved.  there was no reserved sign on the table and the entire time we were there, not only was no one ever seated at that table, no one was even seated nearby.  our remaining 2 party members arrived and were told not only could they not enter the establishment but they could not sit with us because the rules prevent more than 6 people at an inside table.  again, we\\'re were sitting outside.  either this place should not be in business or the \"manager\" should be forced to take training classes in the hospitality industry or be fired.  we will never come back here again and will tell everyone we know not to even bother coming!, went for the 1st time since the re open, cool atmosphere. ordered the brisket poutine because it just sounded gooood!!! unfortunately it was just eh! when i asked the server if they normally don\\'t put brisket on the brisket poutine she said it\\'s chopped up real fine, it\\'s there. i said i\\'ll keep looking however none was found also i would recommend working on the portion size, french fries are cheap more than a measly handful would be nice. we did not order anything else as i saw other food walking by and was skeptical., we\\'ve been meaning to check out craft hall since its new dog park beer garden installation. currently, this is the only beer garden in the city that has a dog park so we were really excited to see what it has to offer. when we arrived, the dog park looked pretty crowded so we decided to grab a couple of drinks in the outdoor dining area.\\n\\nthere were other patrons dining outside with their dogs and it was a nice environment except for the occasional loud motorcycles on columbus blvd.\\n\\nmy husband placed our drink orders and a dog biscuit through contactless ordering. our order arrived not long after. the drinks were all right. the dog biscuit was huge, which was great, but it was so hard to break into pieces and chew that we decided against giving it to our pup.\\n\\nwe also noticed many small shards of broken glasses on the ground in the outdoor dining area. a dog could easily have stepped on it and gotten hurt. my husband and the family from a neighboring table picked up the pieces of glass and removed them from the area but i\\'m very upset about this.\\n\\ni really want to like craft hall but i don\\'t think we will be back., this place is a joke. we had an abysmal experience because of the \"management\".  our party of 8 had come together because of a death in our family and were were treated horribly.  the manager, gestapo, führer, whatever you want to call her is clearly on a massive power trip and feels that covid has made her more important than she will ever be.  we came in the door and asked for a table.  she proceeded make us wait an inordinate amount of time while she stared at her ipad as if trying to find us a table in an establishment with only 4 occupied tables.   she then rattled off the mask rules in a condescending and insulting tone and when asked for clarification of her over the top and above standard rules, she abruptly shut me up and held up her hand to stop me from speaking.  we were taken to our table which was a picnic bench style and outside.   there were 6 in our party and we were expecting 2 more.

we\\'re were sitting outside.  either this place should not be in business or the \"manager\" should be forced to take training classes in the hospitality industry or even better, be fired.  we will never come back here again and will tell everyone we know not to even bother coming!, horrible experience, will never return or recommend this place to anyone.\\n\\nwe came in on a saturday and the place was nearly empty. the website specifically says, service animals are allowed with proper documentation. as soon as i entered with my service animal the general manager, josh, ran up to me and my group and refused service. he told us that service animals are not allowed by the company. he was rude and uncooperative. we came in with our family of 10 with small children and we were asked to leave.\\n\\nto be honest, it felt as though there were other things at play here, more than josh\\'s lack of knowledge regarding service animals and the law. this was one of the worst experiences and we will never come back again., while i understand how some places can be wary of dogs in their establishments, craft hall\\'s website encourages bringing service dogs! but josh rudely kicked me and my family out - this type of discrimination is illegal under pa law. even if he was confused or misguided, it really doesn\\'t make up for his aggressive behavior. we had children and my elderly parents with us! this wasn\\'t the family friendly atmosphere the place was going for., tried to come here on a sunday afternoon to have an early dinner with out of the state family and was rudely told that it was 21+ always unless with a parent/guardian. it was 5pm on a sunday, i never had this issue elsewhere before. so we had to take a tired toddler and trekked elsewhere because my 20 year old cousin couldn\\'t get in. i understand the 21+ rule after 9pm but not during the day. and if that\\'s the case, it should explicitly be said on the site., i went for the dog park experience and all i can say is, \"get a waitress outside\" because after ten minutes of trying to load the app, it just wouldn\\'t.  i hate all qr code menu ordering.  so i had to go in and really, i don\\'t want to have to leave my dog with a stranger bc the website didn\\'t load.  and $11 for a margarita rocks in a plastic cup... it\\'s asking too much of the patrons., i love the idea, but not the execution and what that idea actually looks like...  the draw for me was a playground combined with a bar.  what could be bad about that?  i can have a beer or two and my 2 year old can burn energy on the pirate ship playground.  \\n\\na few problems.  first, the beer wasn\\'t very good (didn\\'t have any food) and until they refine their brewing, they need to offer at least a few other local brewers\\' offerings.  second, somebody is going to get hurt.  there is just too much glassware and areas where kids can fall (adults were not even honoring the no glassware on the pirate ship sign).  it really is just a matter of time.  as another parent put it, \"this is my nightmare.\"  third, many of the older kids (6-8) ran amok unsupervised creating problems for younger kids (for a while older kids took over the slide by only going up the slide...).  i might have been there on a particularly rowdy afternoon, but as i said above, it\\'s just a matter of time before someone gets hurt. \\n\\nand, while i\\'m not a playground lawyer, i don\\'t think their no glassware on the pirate ship signs will save them from liability., food is just bad, they don\\'t require mask wearing, service is terrible and the play area is unsafe. all around disappointed., i made reservations and when we arrived there was a sign that said take a seat anywhere (i even waited and wanted to speak to someone because i had a large party and wanted to sit where i was supposed to. it got crowded after two hours and other patrons came over and tried to take our table and i explained we had both (party of 8) and then a worker came over and asked if we had reservations i said yes then another worker came over and asked what the name on my reservations was and i told her. i was not happy because even if i hadn\\'t had reservations i had been there with a large party eating and drinking for two hours and told to sit anywhere even after i had made reservations. i really love this place and everything else about it so was disappointed by this treatment, i went there once years ago\\ni believe i cut my order down when the employee went from picking up trash to picking up my bagels no glove, not even paper.. i don;t recall all the details, but my immediate thought was it\\'s another establishment that has no concept of hygiene and exploits the lack of oversight..to top it off, the bagels were far from fresh\\nneedless to say, i haven\\'t been back\\nbut i realize many people don\\'t care about cleanliness. if that\\'s you, you\\'ll enjoy this place., this is a little bagel and sandwich shop tucked away in a small plaza that is in the middle of a residential neighbor.  we only stopped by for breakfast not lunch.\\n\\nthe service was fine/friendly and the place appeared to be clean.  there is parking in the plaza\\'s private lot and when we stopped by at 8:30 am there wasn\\'t a crowd or wait.\\n\\nwe both ordered the same thing, which was a bagel with lox, cream cheese, capers and onions.  no drinks as we both had water in the car.  we did decide to eat there since bagels and lox can get messy.  \\n\\nthe bagel and lox i found to be average, definitely nothing special and seemed to be heavy on the cream cheese and light on the lox.  my husband said he found the bagel and lox not to be rememberable.  the bagel itself was touted as being a new york style bagel, as per the sign on the window other store info.  i really think that they meant york city, pa style bagel.  \\n\\nwhat really got me though was each not both bagel and lox was $10.75 and our total bill for just two bagels and lox (with tax) just shy of $23 - and that did not include any drinks, etc. \\n\\nbased on the price along i would not return, but the listless bagel was pretty bad too., quick service, but very disappointed by the bagels. nothing great at all, can probably get better quality bagels in a grocery store. certainly not \"bagelicious\"..., the bagels were ok, nothing worth raving about.  but poor customer service in my opinion and a $10 credit card minimum...it\\'s 2011- really?  i won\\'t be back there- i\\'d rather drive a bit farther and get a friendly smile and be able to charge $6!, i must be honest. no way near the quality of a ny bagel. not even close. 3 stars b/c the service was kind, quick and reasonably priced. salt bagels by request only? not sure what that\\'s about. very dense bagels. very limited varieties and kept in plastic tubs. a dozen or so varieties of cookies offered too. 30 minutes from home makes this a one and done for me. bummer., not understanding how this place has the rating that it does...while the women working the front counter are always friendly and sweet, the bagels are far from ny style. please stop overlooking the eggs until they are grey on the inside!, very disappointed in their bagels. was there at 7:15am got a cinnamon raisin bagel with strawberry cream cheese. the bagel was hard, like it had been sitting out all day. my guess is they don\\'t bake them there. i could be wrong but was expecting a nice warm (not toasted) soft bagel. will not be going back there., stopped for a bagel sandwich and had high hopes based on reviews and the sign out front promising new york style bagels. i did a double-take when the (very nice) lady behind the counter told me that it was going to be $6.75 for an egg and cheese sandwich - that\\'s pretty steep for a breakfast sandwich with no meat. but, i was starving and i was there, so i decided to overpay. \\n\\nthis was not a good move.  the bagel was disappointing - it tasted like a lender\\'s grocery store bagel. suffice it to say, there was nothing about the bagel that was new york style, except maybe the price. i should have just gone to mcdonald\\'s and gotten an egg mcmuffin for 1/3 the price., the quest for the perfect bagel continues. not impressed. my everything bagel needed more flavor and seemed stale despite it being 8am on a sunday. won\\'t be back., breakfast sandwich had microwaved eggs, they said the pork roll was taylor and it wasn\\'t - which was also microwaved and whole sandwich had no flavor. place was also very dirty and dark, the actual bagel was pretty good though, maybe one day in my life i will find a place close to home that truly makes new york style bagels, i always hold out hope when i go to a bagel spot that advertises it on their door, and i always end up leaving disappointed. these bagels, as most others in the area are to chewy to be new york style bagels, it makes me cry to eat subpar bagels since i have been spoiled by my girlfriend who lives in the bagel mecca of the world. the same way philadelphians\\' claim pretzels are the same way new yorkers claim bagels, and sadly neither city can replicate the mastery of the other. these bagels are good for the area along with everything bagel located in audubon. however claiming they are new york style is downright blasphemous. not all is bad however the spreads they have such as the lox, blueberry cream cheese as well as breakfast bagels are topnotch. local place for sure, with a very friendly owner who brings the food to you., great local family owned bagel shop. these people writing bad reviews on a local family owned bagel shop should be ashamed of themselves, get a life you losers, the service here gets slower every time i come. 4 people behind the counter and all but one found themselves too busy to ring customers up?? i called to order ahead to avoid waiting this long. then i finally got rung up and paid $15 for two bagel sandwiches and a snapple. wtf! my bagel wasn\\'t even toasted and the eggs are fake. i\\'ll just go to wawa next time, i\\'m over this place., went on a monday morning, and got their special dozen bagels and cream chese for $10.50.\\n\\nthat was a very good start as that seems reasonable to me.   however when we got home and dug into the bagels...they were old/stale?\\n\\nhow could a bagel store have stale bagels after a holiday weekend, and not provide a great product!\\n\\nthe staff were friendly but let\\'s be honest they should be.   highly highly disappointed., i don\\'t get it - this was one of the worst bagels i\\'ve ever had. i got a pork roll, egg, and cheese sandwich. there was one small slice of pork roll about 2 inches in diameter. the egg was overcooked and gray. the bagel was completely flavorless and more like two slices of bread. i would much rather go to a chain like bagel factory or manhattan over this., if no stars was an option that would be it.  the service here is very poor.  i bought my father a gift card but they didn\\'t know how to redeem it.  i took it to buy bagels but the owner started to read the directions to redeem it.  i stated that if they didn\\'t know how to redeem them perhaps they shouldn\\'t sell them.  she told me to leave and never come back.  meanwhile she has $30 of my money.  obviously service is not her strong suit., not very friendly people, i found the older women very stern and not welcoming at all.  i grabbed a half dozen since it was slim pickings 3 hrs before close, and they were already not feeling fresh.\\nmaybe getting there at opening would be better but i will not return to even try it., maybe we got super unlucky.  but the one experience eating here was the worst bagel egg and cheese in my life....the eggs were grey, and the bagel was extremely firm.  neither of us finished eating, and my partner would eat almost anything under the sun! prreeeeeettty,  prreeeeetty preeetttty bad....., disappointed in this place anywhere that cooks eggs in a microwave,  shouldn\\'t be serving eggs to begin with.  bagel quality was sub par,  bagels weren\\'t fresh.  if i could give zero stars i would., i was disappointed with my experience. no one was really paying attention to the customers, they messed up my order however when i went back in to let them know they remade my bagel and gave it to me for free., the waiter really saved the meal.  he was wonderful.  we ordered frites, which were great, and the calamari which was great (not the marinara-next time i will order without).  we ordered pizza with speck which was good but super salty (and i love salt).  the saddest thing was the campanelle with pepper and cheese.  that is so easy to make.  the pasta was really overcooked; just lay in a pool of cheesy oil; it was so salty as to be inedible.  the waiter understood just by looking at it, and he took it off our check.  \\n\\nwe wish them so much luck after the st. james closed.  we tried st. james three times and the food was fine, but the servers had such attitude and lack of knowledge of how to care for patrons. the food just couldn\\'t overcome the pretentious attitude and weird seating (like there would be only two couples in the dining room and they would seat us at a two-seater right next to other couple - really?)   you do want to go there to relax.\\n\\nwe will continue to support this restaurant.  but the menu is really not rocket science - simple is very good, but it has to be done well., extremely over priced. we are that the new mexican place around the corner and got a margarita, dirty martini, two beers, fish tacos and quesadilla\\'s for $45, than we got here which was one glass of table red wine off their tap that was not good, two beers and a meatball appetizer $37., did not like this place. the pastas were absolutely sub par! over priced for the type of food. will not go back here, went to dinner tonight with my friend. i had the spinach salad and the meat and cheese plate. the service was terrible. the waiter was rude and not attentive. the food is overpriced and  mediocre. i will not be back. i advise anyone to go to not your average joes instead., my family and i went to parlor for lunch and i have to say i have never had a problem with the service or food before. my dad ordered the half chicken entree which came out very undercooked to the point where it was bloody and blood was on the plate when he cut into it. it was sent back and no manager ever came out to apologize. it wasn\\'t until we got the bill and noticed there was no adjustment and i asked to speak with the manager. it is also to be noted that we were the only people in the restaurant, so there was no excuse as to why anything would be undercooked. the manager then came out and said this was the first he had heard of the chicken being undercooked and it seemed as though he was blaming the young waitress as to why he didn\\'t apologize. he then said that sometimes things like this happen, as if that is an appropriate response. he then said he was sorry and didn\\'t even offer to adjust the bill. he said he would give us a free pizza, which would only be 12 dollars when the chicken was 23. my mom said she wanted the bill adjusted. he said he would see what he could do. he then came back and said that he \"took most of the chicken off of the bill\". he charged us a little less than half of the full price, which was still ridiculous. he should\\'ve taken the entire meal off of the bill since serving undercooked chicken is extremely dangerous. i will not return to this restaurant now that i\\'ve had this experience., went for lunch with friends. small salad very good (beet salad, bibb lettuce) but if i had not added the chicken, there would have been nothing to it! prices are high for small pizzas and pastas. no soup - disappointing when it is nice to have soup and salad. in addition, my friend requested no dressing on the salad due to allergies and olive oil on the side. her salad did have a sherry based dressing on it, which she couldn\\'t tell until she had a bite and then had to promptly take a benadryl.  no untoward effects, manager apologized and visited the table several times to check on her. she was not charged for the meal.  they were also out if spinach for the spinach salad - had to substitute romaine, but it was only 12:30, not crowded. how do you not have the ingredients for a main salad when you advertise yourself as a salad, pizza, pasta restaurant!  don\\'t plan to return., we asked to have our salad, two pizzas and fish entree all brought together and my son\\'s pizza came at least 20 minutes after the other items. he didn\\'t eat any salad so he was really hungry. after complaining about the wait, we were told that his original pizza had \"a hole in the middle,\" so they had to make another one, but why wouldn\\'t they just bring it to us so he would have something to eat and make the new one as well? the server told us the manager was \"taking care of it,\" but when the bill came, there was no adjustment. i asked for one and got it, but the manager never came over to talk to us at all! the food was good, but it was a completely frustrating experience and i\\'m in no rush to return., when we read that st james was closing and reopening as something new, we were extremely happy. unfortunately parlor is no better.\\n\\nrob wasserman of rouge fame opened st james in 2012, and it was plagued by bad food and drink right from the start. when it shut down at the end of 2014 we hoped that when it reopened, it would have solved its operational problems.\\n\\nthe principle behind parlor is good. italian bites and wood fired pizza. yum, we thought, it\\'s a nice sunny day and some brunch would be awesome.\\n\\nthe drinks arrived, and that set the tone. the sparking wine in the mimosa was stale, and the bloody mary was weak.\\n\\nwe ordered a salad and a pizza, sans meat. the salad arrived a few minutes later, with meat, and the pizza arrived some while later. some while after that the replacement salad arrived.\\n\\nthe food had the same qualities of st james; the salad was only ok and the pizza was soggy and wet and fell apart.\\n\\nit\\'s as if rob thought that it was the formula for st james was the reason for its lack of popularity. but the problem is in the execution, and the people are the same, so the execution sucks.\\n\\ni hope he gets this and fixes it, before parlor goes the same way of st james. the main line sure needs a good place like this!, only thing decent about my visit this afternoon was the salad i had ordered. after immediately walking in, all staff made eye contact, including the manager, and dos nothing to acknowledge. it wasn\\'t a long wait but it was long enough after seeing the restaurant only had 6-8 seated guests in the whole establishment. \\nthe pizza and calamari had very little flavor and was not worth the time and money spent. i couldn\\'t even finish the calamari because it came out lukewarm and the quality was horrendous. good squid is to never be chewy and rubber like like what i had today, and the whole flavor combination with bland marinara accentuated the terrible flavor of the calamari itself. the pizza was another disappointment because of the huge chunks of pancetta that was inconvenient to eat along with the slices. for anyone to really think this place has \"good pizza\" is mediocre and has never had quality food in their lives. sorry but you must be somewhat diverse before writing generic reviews of their food here. \\nthe server was incredibly sweet but unfortunately does not know when to check in with guests after 2 bites of eating and not after the whole order is out midway. so i couldn\\'t even bring it to her attention right away with my issue on the calamari. \\nwill not be returning considering there are plenty of restaurants that serve pizza and calamari on their menu  in better quality., honestly a waste money.  my husband and i had high hopes for our pasta dishes after our pretty decent app of the baked meatballs. the red sauce was good. however, the portion size was not what we expected in terms of meatballs. 6 tiny balls for $$. our dinners were served by a screaming server that our daughter\\'s dish was hot. got it, you don\\'t have to keep screaming it to us. at first glance, it looked as though our bowls were filled with left over pasta and microwaved. there was no taste to either of our dishes. our pasta was dry and not nearly sauced enough. the decor screams delicious, however the food and service scream something else., this place is great if you love soggy pizza, brown lettuce and service that is both rude and slow. hurry in to over spend for a plate of mush and attitude!  i\\'m sure i\\'m another 2 months ownership will fire all the staff- again and change formats- again., we walked in on a saturday night at 8:00 and were seated immediately. i guess this should\\'ve been our first clue. our waitress was friendly enough but had dirty fingernails. this is a pet peeve for me especially for someone in the food service industry. we ordered a pizza, shrimp and pasta and a half chicken. the pasta came first, ten minutes later the pizza arrived but still no chicken for our daughter. another ten minutes went by and i asked our waitress where the chicken was. her response was \" we are trying to make sure it\\'s not raw to the bone \". i asked to see the manager. after a short wait she arrived at our table and explained that they had eight other chicken orders. i said i understood but why bring 2/3 of the meals just to sit and get cold waiting for the last piece. she agreed this was a mistake and offered to restart our meals. we declined just asking that the chicken be served as soon as possible. ten minutes later the chicken arrived for our daughter. thankfully my wife checked it before our daughter ate it because you guessed it, it was raw to the bone chicken. i flagged our waitress down and showed her the dish she grabbed it from me and left. we waited fifteen more minutes and no contact from either the waitress or manager. finally i got her attention and said we would just like a check so we could leave. she said there would be no bill and was genuinely angry with us and still no contact from the manager. we left promising never to return., there was only one other table there when we got there. the service is ok but the it took 20 minutes to get our drink, 2 mix drinks and 1 beer. it seemed like there was no bartender at time, and the manager and server were trying to figure out how to make our drinks. and it taste horrible!! we ordered calamari fritti and margherita pizza, even though they used fresh ingredients, the food had no taste. over all, we did not have a good experience and i will not return., we live nearby, and would have loved to love it. given the mixed reviews , we went in with low expectations and high hopes. perhaps the place had finally shaken off the growing pains that seemed to plague earlier reviews. \\nalas, it was like deja vu channeling the one and two star reviews.  \\n1. runny, wet-paper towel like crust? check. \\n2. well-meaning but poorly trained staff? check.\\n3. indifferent host? check. \\n4. overly-salted dish? check.\\n5. had to call out for server to finally acknowledge? check. \\n\\nyou get the point... the waitress apologized for the pizza being not right, said this time it was due to a \"new cook.\"  given that this keeps happening (read other reviews) i doubt it.  it is likely more to do with the recipe.  they have a \"ferrari of ovens\" but the neapolitan style of crust does not match the kind of overloaded pizzas that they are designing, so all the moisture from the toppings ends up soaking the paper-thin raw dough and not letting it cook. \\n\\nwitnessed the manager crash into a waitress, and the exchange of glares between them spoke volumes. i suspect there is some organizational dysfunction that is beyond \"growing pains.\", upon walking into this or any restaurant that just opened for the day i expect the entrance to be cleaned from the previous day. the carpet coming in was not vacuumed and that and the floor had apparent dirt all over it. the inside of the entrance windows were lined with dust. the empty plate sitting on my table when i sat down had a black hair on it. the salads ordered had no dressing on it, they forgot. i also hope the staff member that sneezed in the kitchen prep area had a tissue and washed their hands. the restaurant only had two other tables occupied., don\\'t waste your time trying to find this place in the worst spot of suburban square. there are at least 5 other places to get pizza that won\\'t disappoint as mu has they will., ate there outdoors (nice) on a sunday evening as a family of 5. the waitpersons were pleasant but disorganized (3 glasses of water from one lady) - then (4) and finally 5 when asked from another. the pasta (spaghetti for one and a pasta dish with cheese for another) were meh. salad was good and fresh. the nice owner came by and asked how the food was, and i should have said that my nicely charred margherita pizza with kalamata olives was soggy - maybe too much olive juice - in the middle. the olives clearly came from one of those big industrial sized jugs of same - lots of olive meat/no flavor. nice decor. nice location but they need to work on the service and the food to stick around., oh my lord! this place just delivered my family uncooked pork in the lomien. i call them up, they said sometimes we make mistakes. i say refund my money, they say we don\\'t do that. i say i\\'m calling board of health department monday morning. she says do what you want, we don\\'t care. they are way higher priced then the others also. eat at your own risk!, ok so about 6 months ago i rote a review saying this is great i take it back. i always order general tos for my kids bc that is what they like with no spicy! i repeat it 4 times over the phone so they don\\'t forget it has been at least 10 times they messed up i finally had enough n went in to speak with who was in charge they had nothing to say but sorry... knw my second reason of this is bc i just ordered yesterday 3 combos a witch has chicken ribs n rice well it worst thing g i\\'ve ever saw no one wanted yo eat not even my kids 30$ to the trash. know u guys must be wondering y well when we bit into our chicken wings blood was coming out they were horrible who feeds people that. i\\'m so done with this place it will be my last time here they won\\'t bring the owner to speak with me i will be taking this to human services with the proof of my pictures., wow ohh wow was i shocked with what happened at lunch today. i ordered food for pickup and when i got home with it realized that it was not what i ordered i then called to let them know i didn\\'t get the right order so they said we\\'ll call you right back i got a phone call from them and got told off saying it was my fault i ordered the wrong food and talking to me like i have never seen a employee speak to a customer like this ever! i called back to speak to the owner and was told he\\'s not here and was told the man that talked to me speaks to everyone like that then few seconds later i hear i\\'ll get the owner real quick so they lied to cover up so the owner wouldn\\'t find out! all in all the food i did get had shrimp the size of a dime not worth it!!, do not eat here, i repeat do not eat here. my wife and i both got violently ill after eating here. food was good however not worth the painful vomiting that ensured. stay away! please do yourself a favor and stay far far away, over priced for a quality!!! quantity of the food was ok. not recommended place in bucks area, unfortunately, i think i\\'m done coming here after years of this being my local go-to restaurant for chinese food. the sushi is still good, but their preparation and quality of chinese food has gone down considerably. last time i was there i went with two of the most basic chinese-american dishes around - moo shu pork and sesame chicken. the chicken lacked any flavor, the coating was a strange pale-yellow color, and the pieces were sloppily cut into chunks that varied from small bites to long chicken tender-sized pieces. the moo shu dishes have a growing proportion of vegetables to protein (a sign they are cutting corners to save money). just an overall very poor meal. i have been a fan and regular customer for quite a while, but it\\'s been over a year since i can say i\\'ve had consistently good food come out of this restaurant. so long misto., the store hours are wrong! it says they\\'re open at 9:00 and i came here at 10.. still not open yet! a waste of gas and parking fee., if you\\'re  looking for a pleasant experience with smiling faces ringing you up, don\\'t go here. they have the saddest employees. i feel like i really put the girl out because she had to ring me up today., went to buy a package for a friends who\\'s grandfather passed away. we wanted to spend $80 and when i went to pick the package up today, i was embarrassed. it was on a dinner sized plate and looked like it probably cost $25! we did choose a lot of chocolates to go into the package, which are $19.95 a pound. but for $80, the package should\\'ve been close to 4 lbs - and it wasn\\'t! the only positive thing i will say is that they let us return the package because we were not satisfied. but in the future, i would not go there!, i agree with a previous reviewer. i came here to check this place out. the woman who runs this place or owns it is extremely rude and has a bad tude!!!! she doesn\\'t greet you and god forbid you ask her a question and bother her!! the candy is good but is made sour by the help., my friend and i decided to take the kids over the the candy store after we had ice cream today for an extra treat. we entered the store and there was a woman there who was not very inviting. we took the kids over to the candy section where you can fill your own bags and pay by the pound. well the woman was hawking us as if we were going to steal. i asked her for a large bag for each of my boys so they could fill them (the small bags couldn\\'t hold anything) with the candy they wanted. well my 4 year old son doesn\\'t really understand how it works so as soon as i opened the candy box he tried to stick his hand in it the woman then raised her voice to correct him. he was taken back by it. anyway, the kids start to fill their bags with the different variety of candy. well the woman comes back and says \"you\\'re not mixing the candy in one bag are you?\" with a nasty tone. i explained to her they were as we don\\'t want 5 different bags for different candy. she was annoyed with me shaking her head saying \"no no no, nope that\\'s not right and you will have to pay the highest listed price per pound for the candy.\" i said ok i was fine with that and she huffed and walked away. she could have explained the \"rules\" when we walked in. i\\'ve never been to a candy shop that had rules like that. so we get to check out and she doesn\\'t say a word to anyone, weighs and rings up the candy. my boys candy only came to $5.86! she made a stink over the candy per pound etc. they hardly bought any! needless to say we will never return to this store!, i was going to write this message to marcie blaine, but the only contact on the web site is a phone number, so perhaps she will see this note.  we bought a box of 16 chocolates on sunday at the 13th st. store.  basically 3 sorts:  70% cacao (liberty bell); crispy hazelnut (philly skyline); and raspberry ganache (love park).  at about $2 each, they are not particularly expensive for artisanal -- i\\'ve been known to pay outrageous prices for chocolates all around the world, to feed my hobby!  however, these were consistently dry, hard, and not very flavorful, as if they\\'d been sitting in that case for days.  having tried 2 of each, i\\'m throwing the rest away.  i could mail them back, but it\\'s not worth the wrapping, postage costs, or trip to the post office.  what a huge disappointment -- those who live in phl, beware.  i did ask to sample one chocolate just to be sure i would like them, but this was not permitted. for the chocolate i\\'ve tried in your city, i would say that the local john & kira and also teuscher (which can be bought in many cities) and are far better quality.  i don\\'t get to phl that often, but i\\'ve tried most of what is relatively close to downtown, chocolate-wise., i was not happy with the service, it took almost 30 minutes from when we walked in the door for a server just the come over to ask us what we wanted to drink, the potatoes with our food was not fully cooked they were still hard i was completely disappointed with this place i would not recommend it to anybody and i definitely will not be going back i\\'m only giving one stare because it makes me, i ordered a monte cristo. epically horrible. so greasy, poor quality meats and cheese used. bread tasted under baked.  the only redeeming thing was the fries were pretty decent., so i wanted to like it. service was good, menu has great potential but the food was too freakin salty. all 3 of us agreed our meals were too salty. which is a shame because there was good flavor underneath the sodium. i\\'ll try again down the road when hopefully the cooks learn to relax with salt shaker, tried this new place in langhorne for desert. very dark inside super loud music. is this a diner.? apple cobbler was ok but discovered a big hair after eating half it. there went the romance.  they did comp the horrible treat and gave us a gift certificate for next time. on on our return trip , still dark and noisy. had to use cell phone lights to see menus and our food. they said they couldn\\'t  lower the noise or raise the lights. really???  then everything went downhill from there   raw chunks in the mashed potatoes. horrible time. run away fast, feeling generous here with the 2 stars. chili was meh, not inedible, but hormel would give them a run for their money. asked for chopped white onion and was told they only had red onions, no biggie, then was served with cooked yellow onions on top, weird. fries were coated in old bay and overly salted. fried chicken while super crunchy and moist was the saltiest thing i\\'ve ever been served, truly horrible. my sons belgian waffle was good, but his sweet peach tea was way too sweet and needed to be watered down.  i could go on but they don\\'t deserve any more of my time. take a pass..., well first time customer who won\\'t be returning. ordered through an app, didn\\'t get half my order, called metro and they blamed it on the delivery driver. it\\'s your restaurant, it\\'s your responsibility that the drivers get the right bags. now i have to call the other app to get my refund  because it\\'s no one\\'s problem but my own i didn\\'t get what i paid for? \\n\\nedit - they sent 2 wrong meals out of 3 all with the right name for the order written on each to go container but  not the right food we ordered. maybe there were two orders with the same name but this reads disorganization from the restaurant and staff there.\\n\\nstill lost $12 on my purchase because we didn\\'t eat/want what they sent us and other app wouldn\\'t refund us our full purchase total for some reason. like i said, no need to try again., busy saturday morning arrived to a super pleasant service staffs very attentive before seating. we sat indoors but outdoors was also packed. the menu is large but typical diner food. \\n\\nno options to switch to a side salad instead of fries. which i dont eat.  also everything is fried. yuck. \\n\\nhow about a grilled chicken salad. \\n\\nthe salad selection was very lacking too - everything is super sugary and carby. \\n\\nwish they had just one item in the menu that was healthy. \\nso don\\'t come here if you have any dietary restrictions whatsoever. \\n\\nservice once at table was very lacking. and disappointing. we waited very long for food and when it arrived it was missing items. i don\\'t believe our server was very experienced. he either was very cloudy on his station or simply needs to be way more attentive  to his customers.  nonetheless it\\'s covid time so everyone gets a decent tip regardless. we get it. \\n\\nthe chicken i had was pretty good. but that was it. i did not eat anything else other than some lettuce. the bacon piece was good. it was one piece.  außer flimsy tomato slice ( could have used 2 for that sandwich) \\n\\nso yeah i was really disappointed. i\\'ve eaten at traditional diners recently which have been very accommodating to my meal restrictions during covid. so that\\'s not an excuse. \\n\\nlet\\'s give it another try when the menu gets one healthy entree.  i\\'ll request a more experienced. server though. ;), tried ordering for curbside pickup.  the online order process was pretty easy, selected our meals and salad choices for a 4:40 pickup.  i clicked on the \"i am here\" button on the email when i arrived a few minutes early.  i could see a few orders on the table inside the door, ready to go.  i was the only car there when i first arrived.   around 4:50, i went back and clicked in the i am here link again.  when no one came out, my husband went inside and they handed him our order, which was one of those on the table.  not sure why they would want to know if we were there, and description of my car if we had to go inside anyway. needless to say, it was no longer hot.   when we got home, realized the salads were not in our order either, and a trip back was not an option.  we had the fish fry, which seemed undercooked, as the coating was pasty and tasted like flour, not good.  the fries were cold.   if you are expecting curbside delivery, expect to have to go inside.  we ate inside last year and our meals were good then.  don\\'t think i will try again.  trying to find a way to  send a review or email directly to them is hard to find on their website., was excited to try metro diner but left disillusioned. went to dinner with my wife at 5pm on thursday december 5. there wasn\\'t anything that stood out where i would say wow, that is a great place. here are the things that stood out that i did not like. \\n1. the small horseshoe driveway that encircles the rest. very hard to maneuver with large toyota tundra\\n2. wait time for a waitron, plenty available but no one came to the table\\n3. very dark and cannot read menu, menu print too small.\\n4. acoustically the restaurant was too loud. \\n5. ordered meatloaf, mashed and veggies. came out tepid, not piping.\\n6. had to ask another waitress to find our waitress so we could get the check and pay.\\n7. when waitress came with the check she handed me a ipad style tablet to pay the bill. why do i want to touch a tablet that is covered with germs from other customers touching the same tablet. just disgusting.\\n8. the waitress waited while i completed the payment process. no privacy to consider how much tip should be left. i consider that a private moment and don\\'t appreciate a hovering waitress. \\n9. on way out no one asked how our meal was or our visit.\\n\\nthis place makes panera bread look like diamonds of hamilton. not coming back any time soon, after months of watching the metro diner slowly being built, we were happy to finally stop in and take a look. we actually tried to go last weekend but when we called we were told the wait was 30 minutes. today we waited 10 minutes at about 1pm, so they obviously are getting a good amount of traffic. \\n\\nwe were seated within the estimated time and we placed our orders within a few minutes of sitting. the waitress was very nice throughout the entire meal. i ultimately went with a vegetable omelette and well done hash browns. i asked for my omellete to not be all filling in the middle with egg on the outside, i just wanted everything mixed, like in a fritata for example. i was told this was no problem. my wife got the eggs benedict and hash browns. \\n\\nthe food was not impressive whatsoever. it\\'s basically the same diner fare as you\\'d get any area diner, give or take. my eggs were not great, they looked like a scrambled egg bowl more than an omelette and it was not hot enough. something was obviously lost in translation with my request which i thought was straightforward, but i guess not. my hash browns were good, but i asked for them to be served well done and they seemed to be regular. my wife\\'s hash browns were almost burnt. she called her entire meal spectacularly unremarkable actually. \\n\\nour meal for 2 came out to $25 not including tip. even though the price was average for the area, i would not go back due to the sub par food quality and the fact that there are other diners in the area that are just as good, if not better without the 10 to 30 minute wait., arrived about 7:30 am for breakfast\\ni requested a booth and even though i could see empty booths i was told only a half booth was available.\\nhostess then told me specials were on the blackboard which i had to walk across the diner to see/read.\\nafter 15 minutes of waiting for someone to come and offer us coffee and take our order (there were several servers standing around and talking) we left...never to return.\\nthey\\'d better learn they have too much competition in this area and get their act together or they\\'ll close more quickly than they opened, we were there few days ago around 6:00pm .. ordered two chicken pot pies / thick crust and almost dry inside ugh .. my son had their stew and it was liquidy and flavorless, i\\'ve eaten there before and i\\'d say it\\'s gone downhill...the server was nice tho ..., i went for breakfast with a friend this morning. we were seated within a few minutes of our arrival. drinks came out quickly. however we waited about ten minutes to even receive a menu. my mom and her friend came before we received menus and decided to join our party. they were given drinks shortly after. we asked for just a few minutes to order our meal. our waitress (purple reddish dyed hair) proceeded to sit inside and not come out after about 15-20 minutes had passed. my mom went in to get her and walked in on her conversation as she was complaining to another waitress that \"she just didn\\'t give a shit today\". after she said she\\'d be right out, she walks onto the patio and takes their order before us. enraged is an understatement. another waitress had to pick up her work as she did not come out to check on her tables even other than us. the food came out after a while, she did not offer us any refill on drinks, empty ketchup bottle on the table that i was never even given a chance to ask for a new one, because she sat inside well after we were even finished. another table had to ask the hard working waitress for something our lazy waitress had forgot, while i also had to stop her to get the waitress because she never brought us our check. during these times it is important for us to take care of restaurants, but having her as an employee representing metro diner is a disgrace. she was careless, rude, and could truly as she stayed \"give a shit less\". the food was great but her service is the reason i will not return. if she depends on her money during these times she might want to show it. i feel bad for the other staff who had to pick up her slack because of her laziness., this place is just not worth he money. not seasoned food and for some crazy reason their pancakes were tough!, inattentive and confused waiters could have been either inexperienced or under staffed. bring spf 45 sunblock in case you seated near the neon sign. food was par. bring crayons, tables are covered in paper. bottom line: tonight was my first and last experience at st. tropez., never again. \\n\\new. \\n\\nthe food here was awful, the waiters acted like they had much better things to do and the clientele made me feel like i was eating in penn\\'s cafeteria. i didn\\'t go to penn for a reason, folks. \\n\\nsalmon tartare: there was no salmon, i\\'m pretty sure. it was mushy tomatoes and olives in a ring mold with balsamic vinegar from the christmas tree shop drizzled on top.\\n\\nstriped bass: first of all, im pretty sure it was flounder. second of all, there was no goat cheese as promised. third of all, it tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp all day.\\n\\ndo yourselves a favor...go to the rite aid around the corner and buy $140 worth of beef jerkey and cheese balls. it will be a better meal.\\n\\nxo, wasn\\'t too impressed with their food. ordered the tuna tartare, which never came out :(. had the sirloin steak, which wasn\\'t even that good, and it was also overcooked. fortunately i was with good company, so the food didn\\'t bother me as much. however, i probably won\\'t come back and have the food here again., extreme food poisoning from the seafood paella on 1/3/2011\\n\\nmy fiance and i went for lunch and i ordered the soup du jour (seafood chowder) and the seafood paella, a la carte. he ordered mushroom soup and a steak sandwich. we ate a bit of each other\\'s item--everything but my paella which he did not touch. i wasn\\'t very hungry and only finished half my soup and a third of my paella. a short while after lunch i felt unwell--nauseous and queasy. this uneasy feeling sat with me for a few hours and i thought i better get some food into my stomach. \\n\\nmy mistake was finishing the rest of paella from lunch (yes, refrigerated since i returned home). within three hours of eating i was retching non-stop and continuously and the only thing that came up was the paella--parts and pieces of it clearly identifiable (sorry to be graphic). my vomiting and illness continued for hours until about 2am in the morning when my stomach was empty and i was finally able to fall asleep. i spent the entirety of the next day in recovery with bed rest, yogurt, banana, and porridge as my only meals for the day. \\n\\ni regret several things about going to bistro st. tropez: \\n\\n1. going and spending good money for unsanitary or ill-prepared food that didn\\'t taste great in the first place. \\n2. a whole day of extreme physical sickness and the next day in recovery.\\n3. then i regret that i did not feel well enough to visit the doctor to document my illness.\\n\\navoid avoid avoid!, it\\'s hard to get past the awful service. was there on a business lunch and it took two hours - and we had no additional requests! there was no explanation offered, nor was the place busy. i was there on 4/1 at 12:30. the waiter was difficult, although ultimately accommodating, on substitutions - this mars the experience. the food did not justify the above. i had the bel mer seafood salad - it was tasteless;\\' both the seafood itself and the salad, which was like a ruby tuesday or appleby\\'s salad bar in terms of greens. my friend had the cold salmon salad which was only marginally better. very nice  views but beyond that there is absolutely nothing to commend this place., mediocre at best. food overall was very bland. restaurant week is a tough judge, but the food wasn\\'t anything special so i can\\'t see it being much better outside of restaurant week. definitely a cool view when they open up the shades, but other than that not really worth mentioning., came on a thursday.  i\\'d give the space an a+ - very cool, nice view, romantic, great music.  however, the service was terrible.  only three tables and i had to flag down another waiter for a drink refill.  no bread offered, and the bread that was offered was not fresh.  food was, meh.  maybe the meat dishes are better, but the calamare was mediocre, the risotto ok, the salmon tartare -- well, that was good., i went to bistro st. tropez for restaurant week and unlike many restaurant week aficionados, i eat out quite often and take restaurant week as a great way to try places i haven\\'t been to yet. after a really positive experience at del frisco\\'s, i was really looking forward to a great evening but it wasn\\'t. my sea bass was extremely small and it said it came with potatoes but brought vegetables instead. the desserts were lackluster and the appetizers were fine. i honestly thought the decor was bizarre! you can see its neon light sign from the inside and it\\'s all like metal but it looks like a cozy italian restaurant on the other side. it\\'s quite bizarre and hidden inside the design center. \\n\\nnot terrible, just not worth your $35!, it\\'s a mediocre restaurant and i would never go back. decor is so cheap - we felt that we are having dinner at a random cheap chinese restaurant in chinatown in hawaii... they claim that they are a bistro restaurant but for those who have actually eaten bistro before in your life, you will know this is not bistro by any means. people who work there are nice. we left our credit card there and they called us to let us know that they have it, however, somehow they lost it.... if you want to have good french or bistro, there are tons of restaurants in the center city which are much better than this place., not worth the price. dinner was $155 for 2 people. food was ok, but hardly any traditional dishes, and the dishes they served did not impress me. could be a good spot for a standard dinner outing but never again for a holiday dinner., when i was younger, i lost $50 to a grifter in a game of full card monty.  that was money better spent than on this restaurant. ignoring the bizarre walk through a closed mall to reach the restaurant, the 1980s hip decore (including a blinking neon palm tree), and the fact that the view of 30th st. station was obscured by steamed-over windows, the food was a bland and mildly nauseating affair.  this was during restaurant week-4 courses for $35.\\n\\nthe first course was soup du jour. the best comment to be mustered about this soup by my date was that it was that the soup must be to cleanse the palate. starting a  theme, one potato in my soup had not been thoroughly microwaved, and was cold in the center.\\n\\nfor hor d\\'oeuvres, my date had escargot and i the duck confit.  having traveled to the french riveria, and this being a french bistro, i presumed that the food might be of a similar brand.  i was mistaken.  the escargot was served in a thick and flavorless broth; the snails themselves were chewy, tasteless, and likely from a can.  the duck was not a thigh of duck (as i have always before seen confit served), but rather diced pieces which resembled  tuna from a can, and with which the duck shared a similar flavor.\\n\\nfor an entree, my date had the lamb and i the bass.  again failing to set the microwave timer properly, my date\\'s lamb was cold in spots, warm in others, and in no places hot.  the meal had an appearance similar to a bbq, except without the deliciousness of one.  it is unclear as to whether the lamb bone was actually a part of the meat, or was merely stabbed into the meat for pure presentation as an afterthought.  as for the bass, i am not convinced that it was bass at all-this was a very light, white, and flaky fish; it if was bass, i have never eaten this part of a bass before.  my guess would be monkfish.  it was coated in an olive paste that was clearly not fresh-made. it is noteworthy that no ingredients were fresh, and were all of the cheapest quality., food over salted.  waited half an hour for the wrong wine.  poor service overall.  look elsewhere...., quite possibly the  worst food we have had in a very long time. steak was cooked poorly, salmon was actually salmon cake and it was sour. just really awful meal. it\\'s almost funny how much each item costs., we came in for restaurant week two weeks ago. the food was rather disappointing. we had lamb shank and steak frites as entrees. i am not a big fan of lamb shank. therefore, my review might be bias so i wont comment anything on the lamb. but the steak frites were plain. the steak was well cooked as i liked it to be medium rare. too bad the steak had little to no taste. \\n\\nhowever, the service was great. our waiter was polite and nice. he got my order of steak frites mistaken at first with chicken. when the chicken breast came out, he immediately reordered the steak again., i had high hopes of this place. it advertises a view of the river and exceptional french cuisine. nope and nope. the location is strange and we were squished between two other tables, so our conversation naturally involved the couple next to us. they were equally unhappy with their food. we chose the a la cart menu, i ordered the asparagus soup and my dining companion had the duck. my soup was lukewarm at best, but if served at the intended temperature for soup, i believe the flavors would have been nice. the duck was the best part of our meal. the seafood in my companions lobster course was not fresh and it showed. i ordered the chicken, which was overcooked. the sweet potato which accompanied it was way too sweet and there was an olive mixture which had no business on this plate or any other. \\n\\nthe worst part of our meal, however, was the service. the hostess had a terribly telling fake smile. the table next to us was seated after us and got all of their food before us. we saw our waitress so infrequently that i couldn\\'t remember what she looked like. i would have ordered a second glass of wine, but was never given the chance.maybe i should lower my standards, but as they are this was a pretty miserable experience., incredibly disappointing meal.\\n\\nshort version: the food was good, but not outstanding, and terribly overpriced. the service was just ... odd. and very, very slow. \\n\\ndetails:\\nthroughout the meal, there were a series of odd service mishaps -- i was given a wine list that had no wines in it (and the cover said it was from the long-closed patou), i never received the second glass of wine i ordered, our waitress never came to check on us -- but replaced our burnt out candle within a minute. we waited a minimum of 20 minutes in between courses. (yes, we timed it.)\\n\\nthe food was fine -- nothing was bad, per se, but i\\'m no master chef, and even i can make a pork roast at home that\\'s far superior to the dry hunk of meat i was presented with. our appetizers were good -- but not in any way remarkable or special. \\n\\nthe worst offense was the cheese plate: it was literally only one slice of brie, a candied pecan, two thin pear slices and one and a half grapes (they couldn\\'t spare the second half of the grape? really?) \\n\\nfortunately, we were dining with there with an opentable gift certificate, so we didn\\'t have to pay all of the $100 tab, but it was still outrageously expensive for the quality of the food and the service. \\n\\non a day when the service is on top of its game, this might be worth a visit, but god help you if the stars aren\\'t perfectly aligned. you\\'re gonna be in for a heck of a rough night., this place has taken the number one spot for worst restaurant in philadelphia.  no value...\\nvery pricey, which would have been fine if the food reflected those prices, but i had to send back my main entrée and still could not eat it.  the staff were all very friendly but the food took forever to come out and was disgusting.   cheesy decor, and felt like a retirement home.  i\\'m not sure how this place stays in business, but i\\'m willing to guess it won\\'t survive much longer if things don\\'t change.  when you walk in the front of the restaurant you can peer through a glass window right into the kitchen and see the dirty and disorganized mess first hand!  even with a buy-one-get-one coupon it was a miserable waste of time and money., i came here with my mother xmas eve. we had a reservation and the place had plenty of open seating. not only were we seated next to the kitchen, but we waited 15 minutes for any type of acknowledgment of our presence before deciding to leave. what a disappointment. it\\'s a shame, i\\'ve heard nice things about the restaurant. i\\'d be willing to give it another chance and chalk it up to an \"off\" night., i really really wanted to like this place, but was drastically underwhelmed from the get go.  the location is flat out bizarre, having to walk through what looks like an abandoned mall from the 1940s to get to it.  the view, which i had heard was \"the best in philly\" was terrible... unless you have a thing for a dirty view of the river and the backside of a giant government building.  the food was just average, and for the price, was not worth it.  i had the streak frites, and the whole thing was just very bland and unexciting.  they do have a good wine selection, but my wife and i both agreed we would not be going back., i just....ugh. \\n\\nwe went for restaurant week, and that\\'s the best thing i can say about it.\\n\\npaella: bad\\ncaesar salad: ehh....\\ncroque monsieur my friend had: horrifying (and she got sick)\\n\\nthe waiter was slow as molasses, but the manager seemed rather nice., the best way for be to describe this place is just very odd. \\nwhen we first came in no one was at the host stand so we walked to the back of the restaurant. the waiters passed us but didn\\'t stop to even tell us to wait a minute. we had to stand there a little while before we were finally seated. we were put next to the window which had obviously never been finished right because there were huge gaps letting the cold air in. \\nthe whole week they were only doing the restaurant week menu  apparently, which is a shame, since we really would rather have just done entree and dessert, but we ended up not even completely finishing our entree. the food its self was fine, but not really anything to write home about in my opinion. they did however mess up my order and realized this and grabbed my plate away after having it sit in front of my for a bit.\\ni think one of the biggest things that bothered me tho was i guess the \"ambience\" you could say. its a french restaurant and yes, when you first come in there are a few \"french-ish\" pictures, but thats pretty much where the french stops. the food itself wasn\\'t necessarily french (i had hummus with pita chips for an appetizer-not at all french in my opinion). the dining room we were in was also decorated with some tin-looking material on the walls - the whole room was just kind of odd. when we first came in there was no music on at all and then about half way through our meal they seemed to realize this and put on some latin music. at that point i was thoroughly confused as to what type of mood they were trying to set. \\nit was all just very odd. \\ni wouldn\\'t say it was reeeally bad, but i certainly wouldn\\'t go back., the food was completely mediocre.  the sort of meal that you just want to walk away from mid mouthful.   a bland and tepid  mushroom soup... bland rubbery calamari stuffed with sawdust?..... filo stuffed salmon that had clearly been cooked early and barely warmed again to serve...no sign of the expected juiciness of the salmon or the crispy filo just a flat dull texture and flavor...can\\'t even remember what it was stuffed with something pasty and green......my companion\\'s duck breast was also clearly re warmed and flat...... the saving graces were the flavorful vegetable garnishes, the attractive presentation, and the desserts even when the pastry was soggy. the over enthusiastic service made the mediocrity of the food more evident. with so many good restaurants in philly don\\'t waste time or money on this one, this place was very underwhelming. the decor is tacky, windows were all fogged up so no view here. it was also incredibly cold and drafty. it\\'s been a while since i dined here so while i don\\'t remember what i ordered, i do remember i wasn\\'t impressed. i felt everything was very safe, and i expected more from a french restaurant. don\\'t get me wrong, the food was good enough but there\\'s better french food in philly in a much better setting., went during restaurant week.  one word: terrible.\\n\\n1.  food had no flavor -- tasted like it was prepared much earlier in the day (week?).\\n2.  food was lukewarm.\\n3.  waiter was obnoxious and irritating.\\n\\nonly positive was that food was presented nicely -- just tasted like crap.\\n\\nwould have thought that this was their time to shine.\\n\\nnever again to this place., i was with friends and had a good time but as far as the food in concerned, it was a disappointment. nothing stuck out overwhelmingly positively. my chicken dish was buttery, undercooked, and bland, even for southern french. service was average, and we were the only ones there on a wednesday night!\\n\\nblah. underwhelming. avoid.\\n\\ni might return for their happy hour. the decor is cool and casual, with an open space in the bar area. beware of the jacked up prices though., ok, first of all, we had a group of 13 when we came in, so i\\'m giving the staff a little leeway here, which is why i\\'m giving them 2 stars instead of 1. our family came in for my grandmother\\'s 80th birthday. we were told that there would be a $35 set menu since it was restaurant week. there were two set menus, one that was decent at $48 and one that was seriously lacking at either $23 or $25. most of us chose to go a la carte since the \"restaurant week\" menu was honestly a bit crap. the food was mediocre at best and overall i think it was bland. our waitress was totally clueless. she didn\\'t know how to answer any questions about the menu and had to keep running back to the chef to double check on things. at one point, she completely forgot about my drink order, and after i politely reminded her, she did have the bartender come over quickly, but he told me that he didn\\'t really know the drink menu because they\\'re switching managers and he\\'s redoing the drink menu. he then told me that the drink i ordered was getting cut from the menu since it wasn\\'t any good. when our food finally came out, there was a lot of confusion from the servers as to who ordered what. a few of us weren\\'t served the proper dish, but to their credit they did fix the issue quickly. when it was time for dessert, the waitress was completely confused as to who participated in the prix-fixe menu and who didn\\'t and had no idea as to who was actually ordering dessert or just having the one that came with the meal. in addition, they totally forgot to serve one of the desserts and it took over 30 minutes to get a refill on my apparently crap drink. dinner service took almost 3 and a half hours in a restaurant that really wasn\\'t busy at all. it was completely overpriced, the decor is just weird, the service was awful and the food was ok at best. i wouldn\\'t come back., the first time we tried to eat here we left. after waiting almost 20mins in the drive thru we left. tried again today. got the food and i think it was worse than not getting the food. it\\'s crazy expensive but whatever. the bigger issue is the quality and service. it was like we were bothering them by trying to give them our money. awful service is a product of awful management. i wouldn\\'t go back to this place if they gave away the food for free. wait for the chick fil a to open and maybe they can stop by and see what real customer service and quality food should be like. they should be ashamed charging what they do for what they provide. if you\\'re starving to death still do not eat here., i understand is fairly new but there was no structure employees all over the place. the burgers were too salty, hope it gets better but won\\'t be going back. the milk shakes were too hard felt like ice cream instead of a shake, i went to freddie\\'s the other night close to closing time thinking it would be no issue. they were extremely rude. they threw the stuff in the bag and there was fry sauce all over the boxes and fries. they also just threw the burgers together and had to be resembles once i got home. it was just one issue after another. i will not be back to this location., i wasn\\'t not impressed with the spicy chicken sandwich, onion rings or medium strawberry milkshake that i purchased for $11. \\nmy food was a dark brown which tells me the grease was old. i was not informed by the customer service rep that i had to request condiments on my sandwich either so that was dry besides the pickle. \\ni wish this franchise the best of luck in their endeavors but i do not see myself patronizing it in the future., second time here...once again had to correct the person taking my order! at least this time no cheese!!\\n\\nlast time a nice young lady walked around the dining room and asked how everything was!! not today!! french fries were ice cold!!!\\nnot a fan of inconsistency freddy..., i have to say i got an original burger and it was terrible. it was like eating the old burnt fat from the grill. even the fries were bad. the only saving grace was the milkshake   very good., i\\'m appalled at the behavior and lack of safety precautions this location is demonstrating. they had everyone waiting at the window instead of pulling in the side lot to wait for their order. when i got to the window, 1 person gave my my drinks, 1 person gave my my bag of food, and another person took my payment. i had to deal with possible contact of 3 different people!! to make matters worse, the girl who took my payment touched my hand with her disgusting glove that\\'s she\\'s been wearing her entire shift. every person working there was very young and they were all standing around each other like we\\'re not in the middle of a pandemic.  i had my window almost all the way up with just my hand hanging out and still felt terribly unsafe going there. i\\'ll never go back there again. this establishment does not have proper safety measures in place and the workers do not show any concern for infecting each other or patrons. not worth the risk!!, i ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and i took two bites of it and it was still cold. i was shocked on how it happened because i\\'ve been going to this location for 3 years and never experienced that before. i guess it was busy and people was rushing. food is still great but hopefully it doesn\\'t happen again., employees are unnecessarily rude. i had placed my order at the kiosk, paid at the register, and waited over 15 minutes to get the order. they finally called my number, went up to grab my food and was told i needed to pay first. i politely explained that i paid already. the employee screamed across the room to ask the cashier if i paid, she said yes and that i was fine. i didn\\'t even want the food at this point. it was extremely embarrassing, will not be returning., wrong address\\n\\nthis is not the correct yelp listing for the new super-wawa in media.\\n\\nsee this yelp page:  https://www.yelp.com/biz/wawa-media-4\\n\\ncorrect address is:\\n435 e baltimore ave\\nmedia, pa 19063\\n(484) 445-4423\\n\\ncheck corporate link:\\nhttps://www.wawa.com/stores/8082/pa-media-435-e-baltimore-ave, friendy staff, but i don\\'t go out to eat reheated food. if a restaurant can\\'t prepare breakfast to order there is a real problem. hash-brown potatoes that look like they would have been good a day or two ago and a cold omelet is inexcusable. id have been happier with something from wawa. breakfast is not worth going out for unless it\\'s really good, and this place makes me want to stay in bed., food was good, but service was awful. waited 30 minutes to get drinks for kids before finally just going to get them from another server. no offers for refills, so had to get them myself. it took 45-60 minutes for food to come out and our starter came out after the main course. charged more than menu price for soup and was told the menu was wrong - most restaurants honor listed prices (especially after they are pointed out)., i hate this place!!!!!!!! i ordered take out for my manager and i. the food was cold and didn\\'t come with any butter or syrup. i called back to ask for a whole new meal and i was given attitude and hung up on. i brought the food all the way back to get a whole new order. the girl who hung up on me was also the one who was at the front desk. her name was kaitlyn. she should not be working in an environment where she has to interact with other people. she snatched the food from me, brought it to the kitchen and on the way back her and her coworkers looked at me and she rolled her eyes. she then, in front of her coworkers, holds up two syrups and says \"is this enough syrup for you????\" i said yes and her and her \"friends\" all snickered at me. i told her nothing about this situation is funny and to stop laughing. she looked away for a minute then said \"we aren\\'t laughing at you.\" then wtf else are you all laughing at, girlfriend? i\\'m not stupid. and she didn\\'t think i\\'d acknowledge her rudeness. i finally got the food, she sarcastically told me they wrapped up the french toast so it wouldn\\'t get cold, and never received an apology or a goodbye. i will never return to this location and i really hope kaitlyn receives a reality check and/or a course in customer service. i\\'m extremely disappointed, offended and will make sure none of my friends or family come here in order to avoid them being treated with the same lack of respect., i just went here for the first time with my partner and it was the worst breakfast experience ever. i ordered the lobster benedict and my partner the crab benedict. we both took one bite and spat it out. the crab and lobster both were fishy and rotten tasting. the hollandaise sauce was one of the worst i\\'ve ever tasted. there was this squishy piece of asparagus on the plate that looked like it was cooked a month ago. i highly recommend never going to this place., i will not go back to this location.  rude waitresses that just hung around the counter with nothing to do.  also- not kid friendly ... boo!, i have been to the one in wayne and exton many times but we just moved to glen mills.  the breakfast food tasted old.  the bacon had the weirdest taste, my niece and i both spit it out.  my hash-browns tasted funny and were chewy.  also sooo many employees standing around the counter near entrance.  kinda disappointed since we love the other locations!, first time eating at the nudys in chads ford. not the best nudys i have been too! our server did not care to serve us, she gave us our check maybe 5 minutes after we got our food while we were still eating. strawberry cheesecake french toast was amazing per usual. most likely will not be back to this nudys location, i want to give nudy\\'s a better rating because the pancakes are great but unfortunately i can\\'t. i visited this location for breakfast today. while a server was bussing a table i watched her use a towel to wipe up spilled liquids on the floor surrounding the table and then use that same towel to wipe down the table once the plates were cleared. there was a manager with her who saw so clearly that isn\\'t something out of the ordinary. absolutely unsanitary and disgusting. if they use those practices in an area where customers can see one can only wonder what they do out of sight..., dishonest and not very customer centric. my mother purchased a $25 gift card for my mother-in law and as they went to utilize the gift card after a nice breakfast it was rejected and they were told it was never activated. gift cards are not displayed out in the open and the only way to access the card is through purchase. activation is the responsibility of the employee who accepted the cash payment. unfortunately this incident was raised all the way up to management who still refused to honor the gift card. we\\'re talking about $25 people. my mother is retired and living on fixed income so to her it\\'s a big deal however to the owner of a restaurant who should be focused on ethics and doing right by the customer it should be a drop in the bucket. i will never give this place a penny of my money. classless to say the least., i rarely give out one star. i don\\'t like doing it. but i almost felt i had to save people from this horrific experience. i gave nudy\\'s two separate tries before realizing the food here is on the verge of inedible. the first time, i tried breakfast. i got eggs benedict, it was terrible. like another reviewer said, they give fried eggs instead of poached and the hollandaise tasted like cardboard and was so runny and thin, it looked like snot. the only edible thing was the pancake my son ordered. i think that\\'s why there are so many photos of pancakes in the reviews. pancakes with powdered sugar is the only thing nudys can really make. the second time i went, i couldn\\'t even eat the food. my mom ordered a blackened tuna salad and i ordered the buffalo chicken wrap. the tuna was not blackened, it was naked, unseasoned and tasted so fishy i thought i was going to get food poisoning from trying it. i spit it out. my mom just ate the lettuce. the buffalo chicken wrap tasted like sugar. it was so sweet and not at all spicy. i asked for a side of buffalo sauce to try to help the disgusting flavor and they brought me a cup of mayonnaise with maybe a drop of hot sauce in it for color. eww. i never leave a full plate of food at a restaurant, i simply could not eat it. it was horrific. the waitress asked me if i wanted a box. i said no thank you. she didn\\'t even ask if it was ok, or if she could bring me something else. she just handed us the check. again, i hate complaining. i paid full price for food i thought might make me sick and didn\\'t even say anything. i just figured i\\'d cut my losses and never come again. and hopefully this helps save another yelper 40 bucks or so because their food is honestly some of the worst food i\\'ve probably ever had in my entire life. i wanted to like you guys, but wow, until you step up your food game, i will not be returning., food was terrible - outside seating not open even though it was a beautiful day. my husband ordered a reuben sandwich - very little meat, non-existent sauerkraut. the crab on my eggs benedict was straight out of a can, not fresh & the dish was cold. food overall wasn\\'t fresh & it was poorly made. i loved going there before covid but it\\'s obvious they\\'re struggling now. our server gave us a discount off the check. will not go back., good (but not great) food on best of days- hot food always too cold.  lousy service, always.  in last two weeks i have gone in during weekday hours twice(they are close to my house and have nice salad selection).  in these visits, i walked in at 1 hour before closing time and got eye rolls, watch checking and barely grudging service.  called corporate office to provide feedback, no response.  adequate food, below lousy service, don\\'t waste your time.  i won\\'t be wasting more of my time or money., i have been going to judy\\'s since they opened and used to love it.  the last few visits have really shown the down turn it has taken.  went there last sunday with my husband and he ordered the eggs benedict.  on the menu it clearly states \"poached\" eggs (as it should be); however he got fried eggs instead.  when we asked about this, we were told the problem is the kitchen doesn\\'t have a poacher!  what???  my kitchen doesn\\'t have a poacher but i still manage to make poached eggs.  don\\'t advertise food that the kitchen is not able to make.  very disappointed in the quality lately., very disappointed! i visit here about twice a month for lunch. i just ordered for coworker and myself.  one order was bacon & cheese omelet with the bacon well done.  the bacon was mixed in with the egg and was not\\nwell done. bite into large piece of fat along with other small pieces.   i called to advise them that i couldn\\'t eat this.   they said well hope it\\'s better next time???   didn\\'t even offer to re-cook or offer something else.  well it will be a long time before i visit here again., average is the only word that comes to mind. don\\'t rush here. standard breakfast place that serves lukewarm food. ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯, we tried this restaurant for brunch and it was awful. the food arrived cold and waitress never came back to ask if everything was going. no air-conditioning and lots of flies. it was more humid in the restaurant than outside. the salad my kid ordered had rancid leaves mixed in. it was extremely loud and an altogether stressful experience., first time there got a bunch of different candy.  kids seemed to like it but i got gummy raspberries and they were old, stale, and hard as a rock., nice lady but charged us $12 and some change for a float and a very small italian ice. the float had one small scoop of icecream in it....\\ncorona price gouging? idk, but no way i would have ordered at those prices had i been aware., overpriced- owner has a  sign up stating  you must show a vaccination card or wear a mask. meanwhile she wasn\\'t wearing a mask and none of her friends were wearing masks either. i was trying to buy chocolate out of the case but her friends were busy hanging out in front of the case slurping down ice cream cones. i was gonna spend a mint on chocolate, although it took about 5 minutes for someone in the back to wait on us since the owner was busy playing with her friends. i just bought a few thing for my kids and didn\\'t even bother with the chocolate. the best place around to buy chocolate is bergen\\'s on morris rd  in west point not this place., awful experience. negative, unhappy employees. overpriced! and the owner doesn\\'t care about your experience! would not recommend this place if your looking for a positive place with positive energy! take your money elsewhere where it is appreciated. this place doesn\\'t appreciate paying customers!, over priced dime store candy. cheaper and better ice cream and candy across the street at the skippack pizza, businesses need to stay out of politics and stop trying to force their views on customers.  i was very happy to take my money, walk out the door and spend it with your competitors.  and just so you know, it came up at dinner conversation with a few guests at surrounding tables who were equally disgusted too., saturday day afternoon. come in and sit down. had to tell the bartender we were even there. eventually order some drinks (as in a beer and some waters) take a good while, also put in a order for some calamari. it was decent but they used pizza sauce instead of marinara for the dipping, not great. there were 2 people at the bar upstairs and no one downstairs (except for us). took a good 15 mins for the app. also got a chef salad, a ruben, and ribs with shrimp. took almost an hour to get our food if not more (i know since i put and hour and 45 mins on the meter and had about 10 mins left when i walked back to the car). the salad was \\'ok\\'. the ruben was on stale bread, hard, bland, terrible. the ribs were ok and the shimp were fried, nothing special. we also got buffalo chicken fries for the table (the only saving grace.) after waiting long and complaining the only thing they helped us on was taking one beer off the tab (yay.... -_-). \\n\\nlets just say, if i am in the area again on south and looking for a bite, it wont be at irish times., the fact that i am giving the irish times a well deserved five-star review is of little consequence, inasmuch as it is now permanently closed and out of business. this happened just before labor day weekend., i came here with a few friends during the week and wasn\\'t at all impressed. the place was dead and we quickly discovered why. the fries were bland and desperately needed salt or seasoning of some sort. the chicken fingers were fried too hard making them pretty much inedible. the drink specials weren\\'t as good as i was expecting for a queen village hang out and they didn\\'t offer pbr (suprising, i know).\\n\\non the plus side the service was good and our drinks were kept full the whole night. although the atmosphere was ok, we\\'ll probably try somewhere else next time., i wanted to like this place, but did not.  came here for brunch, only one other table.  i was hungover and chugged my first bloody mary, could not flag anyone down for another mary for over 15 minutes, that is no exaggeration.  my eggs benny yolk was solid as a rock, food took over 45 minutes to arrive.  wack, if i could give a zero i would. the food was good, but the bartender on the bottom floor (may 3rd 2014 @10:00) was by far the rudest, most ignorant bartender i ever encountered in my life. she kept inserting herself into my conversation with my friend to argue with me or him about what we were talking about. she constantly kept cursing at us when talking as well. when she wasn\\'t trying to draw away customers, she was on her phone texting away. when our food came out, she ignored the staff bringing out the food, making the staff ask us. in the end, she told me to \"get the fuck out of here\" because i asked her why she kept cursing at me and giving me attitude. i will never go there again unless the owner him/her self personally lets me know she no longer works there., run go somewhere else. food is awful and the place is dirty. service very slow., went here again last friday. rebel songs abounded. musician knew every single one of my requests. somehow our bar tab ended up being more than our food bill--and we were okay with that., i just remembered that i\\'ve an unused groupoun voucher for the irish times, from 2011. whaaaat?!\\n \\nwell, raise your hand if you ever bought a restaurant deal, and it expired before you got the chance to use it, perhaps because you forgot (simply and mistakenly!)\\nok. hands down. you know i can\\'t see you. and if it\\'s any consolation, i\\'m the same way. \\n\\nit was another rainy spring day, and i was in need of some good comfort food. the answer to my rainy blues was that forgotten gift card from 2011.  so, i stopped by the irish times, for an early dinner, and it was empty. empty on a random sunday? really? i started taking quick bites from my mediocre swiss beef burger. a good burger has its place, and it\\'s not here.\\n\\neven though the bartender was actually very nice, i don\\'t think i\\'ll be back any time soon, and only on new year\\'s day mummers parade and/or st. patrick\\'s day.\\n\\ntwo and half yelps., we ate dinner there last night after reading good reviews of the food. the first clue should have been that we were the only ones there eating dinner. so you would think our food would be hot when we received it...not so much;(. the fish and chips were soggy and i questioned whether or not the fish was completely cooked...total disappointment and would never go back., garbage. the food is mostly inedible. drinks are way over priced. it smells like piss. unwelcoming staff, the owner especially. i\\'m all for dive bars, but this place is in desperate need of some upgrades., ok pizza-margarita pie was burnt! i mean charred. they brought a new one a bit late . never got bread. not sure i\\'ll go back..., this was my second restaurant week stop this go-around and tbh i was v disappointed. it was a true bummer!\\n\\nso, my qualms were mainly the food - for starters it was four courses. the first course was an antipasto board and let me tell you, it was a sad excuse for an antipasto board. i was looking forward to it most, but it turned out to be dry and bland. there were little cheese balls and olives and i don\\'t even know what else. i can\\'t remember because it was so forgettable. \\n\\nsecond, i got the verde salad and it was eh. it didn\\'t have enough avocado and it was also way too bitter. i was so excited for the pasta i ordered, but was again...sorely disappointed. the servings were small and it was extremely garlicky. for dessert i got the \"chocolate cake.\" it came out and my friend said, \"is this cake for ants.\" it was a tiny little circle brownie that you can get pre-packaged at costco. \\n\\ni would totally understand if this spot had small portions cus the food was decadent and luxurious, but it wasn\\'t at all.  it was nothing special or tasty. \\n\\ni did like the aesthetic, although casual, it was also modern and chic. it was located, however, in a weird spot attached to a we work on 24th and walnut. \\n\\nin all, i probs won\\'t be back and 24 has gotta step up their restaurant week game!, garces is at it again.  ordered delivery tonight and only received half of the order.  claimed they were out of meatballs for one of only four sandwiches on the menu.  no call to ask for substitution, they just assumed the person who ordered the sandwich did not need to eat!  had same experience with garces\\' rosa blanca before it went under.  no wonder he is crashing.  but i guess it\\'s my fault.  fool me once...., really disappointed by 24. way below the standard i expect from jose garces. we had the roasted beets, the taleggio polenta, the wood roasted cauliflower, and the eggplant pizza. the cauliflower was the star in an otherwise lackluster meal. the polenta had no taste. the pizza was the biggest disappointment with undercooked, soggy crust. the restaurant has a similar menu as barbuzzo and wm. mulherin\\'s sons, but does it much much worse. the pizza is much worse than what you can get at pizzeria vetri. i would not go back as for the same price, there are many restaurants with much better food. the ambiance of being in an office building is also very odd., the restaurant is nice and the food was not bad however the service was extremely poor. it was a date night and they even had a valentine\\'s special going on. the waiter rushed us throughout.the main course was served immediately with appetizers.  the waiter even offered to take our plates while we were eating and we had to tell him we were not done. we were out of the restaurant in 30 mins. not a great experience for a date night. might be good for an everyday lunch/dinner when you want to finish your meals and get back to work/home quickly., like many other reviews, the service was slow, so by the time we got the plates for the pizza, it was warm at best. i\\'m sure it tasted better hot, but i don\\'t think i\\'ll ever find out. the hostesses had an attitude problem!  drinks are expensive relative to pour and other restaurants. we live nearby and hoped it\\'ll be a favorite new place, but no more. the food wasn\\'t bad, but the experience was a turn off. avoid., i ordered the verde salad, described as \"arugula, fava beans, bianco sardo, avocado, grilled lemon vinaigrette\". there were, literally, two tiny leaves of arugula and the rest romaine! not to mention no avocado  when i mentioned this to the server, he spoke with the kitchen and came back and said \"that is arugula\". what???!!! i know my leaves! now i never do this but i asked for the manager...i really just wanted to make them aware of what they were serving and what was happening. it got worse. she told me it was supposed to be a mix and it must be \"confusing\" for me. again whatttt??!!! then i showed her the two tiny arugula leaves i found. she told me the cooks must have grabbed a smaller handful of arugula throwing off the arugula to shitty romaine ratio (i\\'m paraphrasing). i couldn\\'t even bring up the avocado (or lack there of) situation. needless to say i will never go back. and probably never go back to any garces establishment., we went to watch the super bowl, because based on their website, they had some specials going on for the game. well, they only have 2 tv\\'s, so not exactly a good place to watch a game.\\nlucky for us the place was empty and we got seats at the bar, right in front of one tv. bartenders had no idea there were super bowl specials, and i had to pull up the website to prove it to him. we had to ask for menus, and flag them down every time we needed a refill. just awful service.\\nwe also had an incident when paying the bill, where the guy seemed confused about multiple payment methods. so he left a pile of $80 cash on the counter, and put the balance on the credit card. so when we asked about it, he pretended he didn\\'t know what to do with cash...so he was just going to leave it by the register?\\ni could see if this type of service happened when they were slammed, but there were not many people there. \\nnever again., sat at the bar with my wife for a quick dinner after she got home from the train.  food was ok service at the bar was worse.  waters weren\\'t refilled, drinks weren\\'t either, bartenders seemed too interested in talking to their friends and just generally did not care.  we weren\\'t asked how our food was, nobody came by to clear our plates long after we were done.  this is the second time we had been here and both times i gathered this kind of attitude from the bar.  it\\'s a shame because i really like the concept and am always up for pizza on a friday night!  but i will never be going back., waited for 42 minutes when we made a 9 o\\'clock reservation. not impressed, so we didn\\'t stay.  menu looks good so there is a possibility of giving this place a second chance. but not a big possibility., i order a pizza from there, it wasn\\'t going to be ready for almost an hour later but i live close by so no biggie. i arrived a little over 10 mins before my ready time and was told it would be ready in just a few mins. i sat and waited and waited and waited. finally over fifteen minutes after the time i was told it would be ready i approached the counter because another pick up person came in and was immediately handed his meal. i asked if my order was ready and was told not yet they got a little backed up, but then the server sees the pizza box that had obviously been sitting there awhile and says oh here it is! then hands me a cold congealed pizza that was very small for the price and looked pretty bad. (note, place was not busy at all).\\n\\nit wasn\\'t so much the fact that the pizza was forgotten until i said something, it was that no attempt was made it fix the obvious screw up. things happen and i am a reasonable person.  they could have said sorry we messed up, let us make you a fresh one, or give me my money back or even just apologize. they wasted my time and my money and seemed perfectly ok with sending me away with a subpar product and a subpar experience. too bad too because i live really close and was hoping it could be a regular spot. whomp whomp, wasn\\'t a fan. normally love jose garces restaurants but this one was a miss. they clearly just opened and i felt like we were test dummies. i ordered a bellini off of the happy hour menu which was awful and requested a different drink. the waiter took my bellini and gave me the wine i requested but still charged me for the bellini! why did he take it away? i didn\\'t ask him to... the pizza was charred and nothing special. zavino and pizza vetri do a better job. also ordered the meat board and asked which items had beef as i don\\'t eat beef. the waiter said two items had beef and two did not when the board came out 2/3 items had beef in it. will definitely not return and will reconsider before going to other garces restaurants again, i had really high hopes for 24. being attached to jose garces one shouldn\\'t expect less. however, brunch today was definitely lacking. first  one of the more popular dishes was not available, poor planning on management\\'s behalf. 6abc featured a special meal deal for brunch this weekend. one would think that management should have ensured all items for the very limited brunch menu was available, but it was not!!! our server was not the best either. lacking in the professional appearance category and when my husband asked for salt and pepper he recieved 2 salt grinders. our server never returned to inquire how the meal was going after our first few bites. \\nall of this and my husband and i were the only ones in the restaurant, so it can not be chalked up to being busy. we will not be returning! \\n\\nwhy 2 stars you ask... because at least what we were actually able to order did taste good., they describe this place as on the river, but your outside view is of a parking lot, and your view from the booth is of the gym across the street...not quite what i was expecting. \\n\\nthe service was good but the menu leaves a lot to be desired. the wine list was pretty unexciting. i was excited to order the caccio e pepe, but it was almost inedible because it was so incredibly salty. i felt like i was chewing on whole salt granules. overall i was unimpressed., mediocre food, overpriced for its quality. the pasta we had was too salty probably because the cook didn\\'t know guanciale is already salty and then added too much extra salt. won\\'t come back., food was not horrible but the service was. we went with some friends who live down the street and had the kids in tow. \\neveryone order and the apps come except mine.  i wait. i wait some more until i ask our waiter if he has forgotten my appetizer to which he replied, \"no\". \\ni tried one of sons meatballs and had half the meatball on my plate. the waiter comes to remove everyone\\'s appetizer plates and takes my fork and begins to take my plate. i politely said i was finished and he says i wasn\\'t eating it ( not fast enough for him obviously probably bc i am attending to my 2 yr old)\\nwell, the entrees come and he brings my appetizer (with my entree) but says nothing. just drops it off with no explanation or apology. \\ni taste my blah appetizer and am trying to feed my son when our so-called waiter comes back (we\\'re ten minutes in to the entrees) and asks if he can box up my entree, which i haven\\'t touched. i inform him that i am trying to feed my son and have not yet had a chance to even eat it. wtf? get a clue! i\\'m attending to my son. the restaurant is packed with kids so this shouldn\\'t be new to him. \\nwait staff are the face of a restaurant and this one failed., i\\'ve never experienced such rude waitstaff in my entire life. we were sat by a hostess after a few minutes but both waiters continued to ignore us even though we tried to order. they did not give us water or plates or menus, and even though they said excuse me and tried to get their attention, they blatantly ignored us. no one in my party has ever seen anything like this before. i do like 24 for the food but this service will make sure we\\'re not coming back., do not waste your money there on resturant week. the food is on average and there is no service there. we have spent $37 per person(include tax and tips) on resturant week lunch. we only have ordered two glass of wine and a beverage in addition to the fixed lunch menu. the glass wine is so little! it should only be half glass at other places! \\n \\nvery diappointed! we will never go there again., i wanted to like this place so much but it really did not live up to any of the hype i created for it in my own mind. \\n\\nthe good: the waitstaff was welcoming, kind, and efficient. we didn\\'t go long waits in between courses. the decor was pretty nice too. it felt like a cozy chic cabin. it had tvs and the kitchen area was open and you can see. \\n\\nthe bad: the food was underwhelming. i got the calamari (which is not fried), the four cheese pizza, and the pistachio dessert. i really didn\\'t feel like i loved any of it. the calamari was nicely cooked but just really bland. the sauce it was with was good and probably the best part but as soon as my waiter saw i ate the calamari he took the plate with all the delicious sauce. that was bummer. \\n\\nthe pizza was good except there is absolutely no need to put blue cheese on it. it really made it bitter and frankly inedible. i\\'m surprised so many people liked it. i can think of ten different cheeses that would have been better than blue cheese for that fourth cheese. \\n\\nthe dessert and drinks were forgettable. \\n\\nthe ugly: you know this restaurant is positioned right over the river and that was a big draw for me. however over half the restaurant has little or no view at all. our view in the booth was of people sweating in the gym next door and various construction cones. my table mate had a view of the offices that were located in the building. that was a hugeeeeee let down. \\n\\nall in all: i probably won\\'t be back but you should definitely give it a try at least once., traveling from out of town and thought i would give 24 a try.  food was okay, i thought the crust of the pizza was really thin and flimsy.  service wasn\\'t the best and their wait times for food could be improved.  we spent almost an hour waiting for food., the four of us had a 9:15 reservation and had to wait 25 minutes for a table.  waiter tried his best but bar and kitchen slowed our service.  cauliflower was fab so was salad and meatballs.  margarita and pepperoni/mushroom pizzas we 2000% to salty.  could not eat either.  \\nwill go back for a pasta try.  hope this place makes it., services was slow if you could find the waiter....\\npizza was was cold and soggy...\\nbtw.. this is not remotely italian food, it was more like, what spice do i have in the kitchen... great ! put it in.  \\n\\ngood wine selection., i really wanted to like this restaurant but it really did not live up to expectations. the meatballs were very good as a appetizer, but everything else wasn\\'t that great. the server ray was very sweet and attentive to our table. but everything else was not really worth it. the bathroom situation was odd too., waited for several minutes at one of two hostess stands.  several waiters walked by without acknowledging me.  two bartenders saw and said nothing.  and neither hostess came over, though one was looking right at me.  so i left.  garces\\' customer service, it appears, has taken a slide.  too bad.  that used to be a strength., the pizza was pretty good, and service was very good. but the polenta was terrible. i\\'ve never had such a salty dish in my life. it\\'s like they accidentally put in tablespoons instead of teaspoons or something. \\n\\ni interspersed bites of other food to dilute the saltiness, and i went through several glasses of water, but it was still too much. i ended up leaving 1/3 of it at the bottom, and left hungry. i\\'m marking this as 3 stars--even though this was just one dish--because no good restaurant should have such bad quality control that a dish can make it out of the kitchen this out-of-whack., worst wawa i\\'ve ever wen to. one entrance/exit in front causes traffic making exiting the front difficult. grocery style lines makes it crowded an hard to get back to pick up your food. run out of popular item every time i\\'m there. i try to never go to this wawa if possible. which is hard now that sunoco closes early (24 hour establishment) we have enough giant wawas. one on trooper one on whitehall both very close. made already busy intersection a madhouse. this wawa is of poor design in a worse location., i expect all employees behind the food prep counter to have either a baseball cap or a full hair net. a visor-only is not acceptable as a hygienic solution for anyonein food service, where the top of the head and hair is exposed. i dont blame the employee, i blame management at this location., every time you go here for a breakfast sandwich they are sold out for everything and your waiting 20 minutes\\nyou would think that efficiency would be involved in the equation.   nope.\\nits the same thing every time., this wawa doesn\\'t seem to care of you get a roll that stale or not.  you\\'ll drive away only to find out later.  is it the low-carb option to stop me from eating the bread?!  i\\'m pretty sure i didn\\'t click that., i called around 11 today to see if an arrangement could be made by 330-4 for a death in a friends family.  on the phone they were extremely helpful and described what i\\'d be getting for $76/$77. she tells me chocolate covered strawberries and some fruit covered on hazelnut.  i remember thinking wow hazelnut was her favorite how funny. well i get there and read the sign that says $1.99 for a small fruit salad which i ordered if you spend $29. i spent well over that yet i\\'m charged 4.99 then they rush me my arrangement that looks extremely small(ordered the med)  and missing things.  not thinking i walk to my car. looking at it further theres nothing covered in chocolate!  they gave me fruit on a stick with lettuce looking stuff at the bottom.  they obviously threw this together in the ten minutes that i was standing out front waiting.  i take it back and ready for this one... and i quote \" we are slammed and ran out of chocolate covered stuff so your only missing like 10 strawberries with chocolate on them! \" i said so you charge $100 for fruit on a stick not covered in anything?  she says, and i quote \"you didn\\'t pay $100!\" i say $80 is close enough to it,  she says \"well that ain\\'t $100!\" are you kidding me????  if i wasn\\'t in need of this today i would of walked out!  i can\\'t believe this.  another gentleman who was an employee just took there and watched.  so they tried ripping me off and i caught them! what would of happened had i had this delivered??  i never would of known!  i plan on calling speaking to the owner as asap!  don\\'t go here,  they have the most ignorant people working there., i created a yelp account just for my experience with this particular store.  i had heard from others that edible arrangements provides great service, but unfortunately i had a different experience.\\n\\ni placed an order on friday, 1/9/15, for a delivery at a nearby office on monday, 1/12/15.  at around 12 pm, i tracked the order and it was out for delivery.  there was never an attempt to deliver to the office.  i called at 3:30 and the person on the phone said she would call the driver and give me a call back, which did not happen.  i called again an hour later and was told that it would be delivered the next day.  it was not delivered, and i did not receive a call back again.  on tuesday i called the store at 4 pm and the person on the phone told me that my delivery was in their fridge and that the driver was not there to explain the situation.\\n\\ni then requested to be refunded because the person it was to be delivered to was not going to be in the office on wednesday, but it was delivered anyways.  on wednesday, it was finally delivered to no one.  this is two full days after the order.  i was told a manager/owner would reach out to me regarding my case (which i filed with the corporate customer service for edible arrangements ), but that has yet to happen.\\n\\ni guess this franchise believes they can just deliver arrangements whenever it is convenient for them.  i understand things happen, but two days go by and they never contact me back, and then they deliver after i ask to cancel the order since the recipient won\\'t be there?  unreal.\\n\\nupdate - i called the store back again today on wednesday and explained the situation to a manager, who said i would receive reimbursement for my purchase.  the arrangement was still enjoyed by a few co-workers, so i have bumped this to two stars.   i do not think i ever would have been contacted regarding my order being late, as i had to call the store 6 times in 3 days before i was able to resolve this., i spent $175.00 for a basket to celebrate a friend\\'s new baby on a friday at 4 pm.   a representative then called and said that it was too close to closing time (6pm) and then asked whether it would be ok to deliver the next day (saturday).  i agreed.  it is now monday at 5:22 pm and still no basket.  i called and the same lady immediately stated that the basked was delivered on saturday.  when i challenged her she placed me on hold only to return to the phone and state that she will send the delivery out tonight.   \\n\\nin short....stay very far away from this particular franchise, particularly if you care about having things done right., a skunk is pig\\'s clothing. \\nfirst, it is not a \"gastropub\". it\\'s barely a pub. shot and beer tavern at best. went there with my cousin since i saw they did renovations and changed things up. you look at the outside and think you\\'re getting one thing, get inside, and step into a poor dive bar. if that is what you are shooting for, then don\\'t be embarrassed about it. make the outside look that way, not like a downtown \"irish pub\", and then keep the inside unchanged. thought they had a wide selection of beer. uh, no. didn\\'t even hang to try the food. just a weird, uncomfortable feeling inside. felt like there was something seedy going on.\\ndefinitely won\\'t be back., i\\'ve eaten at this restaurant many years ago on walnut st. ......should i say, this \"infamous\" establishment.....ha ha ha !! of course, the gentleman i was dating at the time, wanted to experience so much of what philly had to offer ie, restaurants. my on the other hand, takes much to impress me..the decor, hmmm? not much to be desired for, the lighting was very dimmed, i suppose this was to be \"romantic\"...bad on the eyes, when it was time to read the menu. i ordered \"porterhouse\" my all time favorite....these steaks costs $35-40 me being the analytical person that i am , simply because, i am a steak lover...this steak at that  particular time, did \"not\" taste any different than the one i had eaten at \"capital grille\" not so long ago..or the \"chart house\"....not even \"ruth chris\", which is one of my favorite restaurants. it\\'s how the chef prepares & cooks the steak..overall, they\\'re the same steak...but !!!! your paying for the name of the restaurant & the location . \\n\\nsynopsis: some of us tend to think if, we eat at these fabulous restaurants / at these great locations ....fireworks are going to go off in our brains...angels will sing. unfortunately !!! things like this does not happen simply because, we\\'re eating an $30-40 steak ...i realized / accepted this when i had eaten at this restaurant many years ago., i tried to book reservations through yelp, they confirmed my reservations, i called the night before just to confirm my reservations was still there, i was hung up three different times, spoke to a manager just to find out they do not see my reservations and they was having problems with yelp. this ruin my plans. call this restaurant if you want make reservations, morton\\'s steakhouse simply isn\\'t worth it.  everything about my dinner there was lackluster.  but the most important question is, how was the steak?  my 8oz filet was overcooked (medium instead of medium-rare), burnt/blackened on top, and lacking in flavor.  my date\\'s slightly smaller filet was properly cooked (medium rare), but was similarly lacking in flavor.  the chocolate cake dessert was okay, but i\\'ve had better at local diners.  to make matters worse, our server did not introduce himself and was not pleasant towards us.  there are so many wonderful steakhouses in philly.  morton\\'s just doesn\\'t happen to be one of them., the food is not good at all. came here for resturant week and the lobster bisque was the most disgusting thing i have ever had. and i\\'m pretty sure it was spoiled because i got sick after. the mashed potatoes taste way too much like horse radish and aren\\'t good at all. the salmon and steak were just ok. the service is just okay too. the waiters have no idea what\\'s going on with the tables and like 4 people came up to us to ask what we want to drink when we already had drinks in front of us but no food menu to even order food. this restaurant isn\\'t worth the money to spend here, even on restaurant week when it is cheaper. i will not be coming back., went to mortons on friday july 1, 2011 and was antcipating a great meal. to say we were let down would be an under-statement. i had the ny strip signature cut, found it to be tough with fatty sections running throughout the cut. it was my first and last time to eat here, was not worth the money spent., we spent almost $600 and they wouldn\\'t allow us landry select points. the food was mediocre even the bone in rib eye. trust us we have been to all of the steakhouses in philly and this is one of the worst. as a new landry select member you would think they would make an exception since we didn\\'t know \"all their rules\" as they never responded to our email when we asked. thus we will never venture into another landry\\'s establishment and this is probably reason #1269 as to why this place and other landry restaurants in philly are sub par. wake up landry, you all have to wake up before you start closing your doors. del frisco\\'s, butcher & singer and barclay prime are the top 3, in that order. morton\\'s is a no no and we would rack them as \"unranked\" like a crappy ncaa basketball team, perhaps we caught them on an off night. it was late, so i understand why the waitstaff was less attentive than normal. after speaking with the bar tender (when i got up from my dinner table to get a drink since the waiter hadn\\'t asked if i wanted a refill after 25 minutes of an empty glass) i was told that the waiter actually lied about not having my selection in stock. \\n\\ndid i mention the $4 up-charge for ordering my single malt scotch neat? how else is it supposed to be served? \\n\\nsteak was medium plus. i asked for medium rare. unacceptable for a $55 steak. sure, i could ask for another, but then then rest of my table would have finished before i received my meal. i don\\'t mind paying for a quality meal. this however, was not., morton\\'s is solid, but extremely overpriced. my family and i went to the philadelphia location for my dad\\'s birthday 1.) because he loves steakhouses 2.) he\\'s a morton\\'s member and they gave him a $100 gift card.\\n\\nthe location is great, right off of broad on walnut street, but the interior needs major renovation. i felt like i was back in the 90\\'s in this place, and it just looked tired.\\n\\ni also don\\'t like that they bring out that cart of raw meat and fish to explain their menu and the specials. first, the whole demonstration took about 10 minutes and we were thirsty and starving. i also don\\'t like looking at raw meat covered in plastic wrap that has been sitting out for a while. not appetizing.\\n\\nmy strip steak was good, but i have to say that the $8 one i purchased at reading terminal and broiled at home was just as satisfying.\\n\\nthe creamed spinach was excellent compared to other steakhouses like the palm, and my cucumber drink with st. germain was absolutely delicious. the breaded shrimp in beurre blanc appetizer was forgettable, as was the chopped salad and asparagus with bernaise.\\n\\nthey gave us a free molten chocolate cake for dessert and it was terrible. very commercial tasting. i\\'ve had better with a duncan hines mix.\\n\\ngo here if you\\'re on an expense account or have a gift card. otherwise, patronize local places like union trust or butcher and singer., ambiance was great, but the food was very bland. i love morton\\'s in nyc, but this location needs to hire a new chef., i was truly not impressed by mortons steakhouse. i feel mislead by the \"prestige\" of this restaraunt. i think some reviews are the root of my confusion as they are a little overdone sort of like the steak i ordered. as a whole the service was great but service doesn\\'t supercede the quality of a meal in my opinion. i really left this place wanting more and that holds especially true because for 2 people i was $300 poorer., the first time i had gone to morton\\'s was 15 years ago, and it was amazing. because of that experience, my friend got me 2x $50 gift cards for my 40th, so i took my wife there for a date night.\\n\\nafter a fantastic meal 15 years ago, i was extremely disappointed in my return trip. i ordered a cajun ribeye at the recommendation of our server, and au gratin potatoes and sauteed spinach and mushrooms for sides. the steak was decent, but i\\'m not sure what was really cajun about it. my wife ordered a combination that included a 6 oz. filet, 2 bacon wrapped scallops, and 3 grilled shrimp. she asked for her filet to be cooked medium, and it was medium rare at best. the scallops were decent, but the shrimp were inedible, as they were not deveined. seriously, how bush league is that? you pay $50 for an undercooked piece of meat, 2 scallops and 3 disgusting shrimp. \\n\\nmorton\\'s steakhouse is extremely overpriced, especially for the quality., got a couple hundred dollars burning a hole in your pocket? do you like spending a lot of money on good food? head to mortons steakhouse!\\n\\nwe recently went here for a friends birthday party. we had to get the 2 person, $50 per dinner deal because we just weren\\'t balling enough to be able to order off of the regular menu. listen.....seriously expensive. a steak, with no sides, no salad, no dessert, no anything, will run you $55. add some asparagus and a gin and tonic, and youre hovering in the $100 range. the \"deal\" came with a salad, a \"smaller\" steak and 2 sides. all the food was delicious and i strongly recommend the sauteed mushrooms. the drinks were good, and our server was very knowledgeable, although he seemed a little annoyed at our group ordering the special.\\n\\ni hate writing reviews so long after visiting an establishment because i forget all the nuances and details that make a good review, but i just hope to convey the gist of the place with this review. the important things you should take away are: this place is good, but you are going to absolutely pay for it. we all chipped in to pay the birthday girls meal, and with that, plus our food and drinks, it was over $120 a person! yikes.\\n\\ni personally won\\'t go back, if for no other reason than the fact that the price is way out of line with what you get. when you go to fogo de chaos and drop $50, you get fed like a king and waited on hand and foot. at mortons, you get a ribeye. its a delicious ribeye, but the markups here are insane; sides for $12, drinks for $17, salads for $10....its just not that good. i\\'ve spent $100 at the mosholu and been ok with it. i left mortons feeling like i had just been raped. its a shame because this steakhouse has excellent steak, and thats what youre there for, but everything else they do seems to sabotage their own cause., we went here to celebrate a special event. to say this place has gone downhill is an understatement! the decor hasn\\'t changed in over 15 years. the carpet looks dingy and dirty, and not even the dim lighting can hide it.  the food - i had a chopped salad that was soggy, and the lobster macaroni that tasted like it was doused in two pounds of butter.  awful. finally, the server made a big deal in bringing out a dessert with sparklers and making a show of it all. very nice, we thought.  wrong - when we looked at the bill, we noticed that they charged $18 for this dessert that we had not even requested. really? typically it would be complimentary.  never going back. do yourself a favor and go to capital grille or the palm., the best thing about this place was our server mikey, in the bar area. he was very friendly, funny and made us delicious drinks.   unfortunately he was not the chef.  we ordered oysters, escargot, and  shrimp alexander for appetizer...  the oysters were tiny and had a fishy after taste.  the escargot was ok.... it had a fatty piece of bread over each piece which i also found weird.  the shrimp alexander seemed like it was deep fried and made me feel like im eating at a fast food chain restaurant.  \\n\\nfor entree we had filet mignon which i ordered in medium.  the steak was really below par.... ive had better in a back yard bbq. it  didnt seem to be marinated at all  and it tasted like plain dry meat with no flavor.  \\n\\nthis place is priced like a 5 star, high end steak house but definitely does not compare to the top tier restaurants.\\ni would never come here again for dinner but would consider coming here for happy for mikey to make us some of his great drinks., another restaurant week disappointment. we\\'ve been to the ones in atlantic city and new york and they were fantastic. the philadelphia location however was not. both of our steaks were undercooked, and there is nothing worse than sending steaks back at a high level steakhouse such as morton\\'s., we went here on a saturday night for a pre-mothers day dinner. the service was nice. that\\'s where the 2 stars come in. i wanted to eat on the lighter side so i ordered the salmon. you think i would know better because its a steak house.  my salmon was dry and bland. the waiter told me it came on a vegetables bed of carrots and spinach,  but she didnt inform me of the chick peas buried under the salmon . which i am allergic to. so i spent the rest of my night sick and in the bathroom. i really did not enjoy the meal. 4 out of my party of 7 enjoyed what they ordered. but i don\\'t think any if us want to go back., t-shirts, shorts and casual sandals are not recommended for dining at morton\\'s.\\nlet me start off with saying that joe our waiter and the wine steward where excellent\\nand the food was well done, but let me discuss the first statement that was taken directly from their own website. they don\\'t mention hats. more on that later.\\ni have dined at morton\\'s five or six times in the past with various attire and i would say all tastefully done. i have been there when people were wearing tank tops and shorts and not told a thing. tonight with my gravati suede oxfords, my scotch and soda pants, penguin sweater and a very tasteful penguin hat, and cashmere coat ,i sat to eat my food and enjoy a well dressed new year celebration.\\nfirst let me say, table 34, was one of the worst in the restaurant. we were seated there and did not no complain.  it had lights behind it that looked liked a tanning booth. the table was close to the bathrooms and near to the service door of the kitchen. i thought a busy new years eve night, but still was biting my lip. we were there to enjoy the night , not complain.\\nas we sat and started to order, the manager or maybe someone in charge says to me, in a rude manner, can you remove your hat, that is not allowed in the dining room.\\nreally, you put us at the worst table in the place and then have the nerve to say to me to remove my very expense, tasteful hat. you would have thought i had a go eagles hat on, with a big foam we are number one hand.\\nwhy did you not tell the man next to me to put his shirt in and remove the tan khakis that have never be ironed or washed? how about the man who was wearing a sports coat from 1985 and moccasins. i can go on, but you get the point.\\n300 dollars later and much laughter about the horrible fashion choices of some of the diners and the bright lights that were blazing behind us, i will never eat there again, even though i have to say the food is always on point.\\nteach your managers how to treat people and teach them a better way to implement the rules across the board for all patrons., i have a problem with a la carte steakhouses.  i don\\'t mind paying a lot for a nice dinner, not at all, but there is something inherently wrong with paying $40 for a steak that literally has had nothing done to it besides being tossed on an extremely hot grill and splashed with sea salt.  no sides, no anything.  just a $15 piece of angus beef you could get from any reputable butcher with a 167% markup.  why the markup you ask?  is it because the chef is using their culinary talents to take that meat and turn it into something extraordinary?  oh no.  it\\'s because of the \"mystique\" that a smoky, wood-walled steakhouse carries.  \\n\\nhow do i review this place?  it\\'s steak.  it was cooked correctly and the $8 side of potatoes was average.  the $8 salad was average.  the waiter was decent, if a bit of a brown-noser.  the wine was a napa cab with a 100% markup.\\n\\ni don\\'t know how to recommend this place unless it\\'s for a corporate function and you think your stuffy boss will enjoy it...on the company charge., don\\'t waste your $$$!\\nunimpressive, depressing atmosphere, mediocre food (hash browns tasted like were frozen), service not at all top notch (our waiter didn\\'t mention or highlight anything on menu or mention specials (had to overhear it from waiter nearby)\\n\\neither wait for the palm to be renovated or try capital grill!, i only ended up here once, cause some friends desperatly wanted to check out some steaks before a hockey game.  i don\\'t frequent chain restaurants that much and i try to avoid them by all means possible, and this place proved it.\\n\\na $40 dollar steak that was tasteless.  it litteraly had no flavor, not even char taste, no juice, even for medium rare. it might as well have been a dish sponge.  boring sides.  mashed potatoes with nothing to consist of.  how about some cheese in them?  cream?  what about maybe garlic?  not even that.  a side of broccoli that was just steamed mush with salt and pepper for what 12 bucks?  are you serious?\\n\\ni think the only great memory i\\'ll remember of this place is seeing ahman green (then rb for the packers) sitting at another table with his line mates with enough food to feed me for 3 months straight.  the shrimp was in a pail no doubt borrowed from the cleaning crew.  it was that big..\\n\\nsave your money and stay away from this place., i probably won\\'t dine at a morton\\'s steakhouse again because i don\\'t have a refined palette for taste.  the reason for this decision is threefold: i\\'m not into steak, the food is unnecessarily overpriced and the food is only decent.  \\n\\ncall me crazy but i expected to be wowed beyond anything i had ever eaten, spending $170+ for a meal for two.  none of the food was bad (i had a chicken dish and the lady had lobster) but nothing was great either.  maybe i shouldn\\'t go to steakhouses anymore, particularly  expensive ones, you say?  maybe you\\'re right, but we were given a $100 gift card, which covered a little more than half of our meal.  also, i can\\'t help but feel a tinge of guilt at being so spendthrift on a mediocre meal when there are so many people the world over with too little to eat.\\n\\ni was going to give this place two stars, but i have to give credit where credit is due, and the flourless chocolate cake is something else.  i felt like the woman from \"the matrix reloaded,\" who gets sent a cake that pleases her in more way than one., don\\'t go. went for happy hour and there was miserable not very friendly bartender. he didn\\'t even welcome me. he just asked what i wanted. didn\\'t explain happy hour or anything. not friendly at all. i am a local and now i know why i don\\'t go there. bar was empty when i left and dining room not much better. it is a shame they have a great happy hour food menu and it is really good., simply put, i wouldn\\'t eat here for free.\\n\\nthe quality is so far out of line with the pricing, it\\'s obscene.  i have no problem with paying $300 for dinner for two, but it better be worth it.  honestly, what we were served at mortons, we would have sent back at tgi fridays.\\n\\nthis is not the same mortons you knew before landry\\'s took over.  do yourself a favor, either go to a golden corral for the same quality at a much better price, or go to a real, actual, legitimate, quality steak house like del friscos, barclay prime, or the palm.  your time and money deserve much more that morton\\'s can accomplish.\\n\\nthe fact that the dining room was 20% full on a friday night at 6:30 in december should indicate to you what others have learned., this was my first real steakhouse experience, and i was not impressed. it\\'s possible that i just am not a fan of steakhouses, or that i just don\\'t *get* what all the fuss is about, but i left feeling monetarily violated.\\n\\ni came here with my husband and his boss for a dinner, and i arrived about 20 minutes before they did. i went to the bar to get a drink. it was $16.00. for one drink. without tip. we are not in nyc, folks. we are in philadelphia, where every other bar or restaurant has specialty cocktails that are delicious and obtainable for $10.00 or less.\\n\\nwhile sitting at the bar drinking my expensive drink, i took in the ambiance of this place. it was not appealing to me. it seemed dated, dark, and uninviting.\\n\\nthe appetizer i had was just ok. i got the \"five onion\" soup, which had barely any broth in it at all. it was basically a pile of onions covered with cheese. i\\'ve had a million french onion soups in my life, and this one was just not great.\\n\\nour dinner was fine. just fine. i got the filet oscar, which was decent. my husband got the rib eye. it was also good. however, my husband could have (and does) make much, much tastier steaks on the reg. i don\\'t need to spend $50.00 on one 6 oz piece of steak, when i could make it at home for much less. \\n\\ni didn\\'t like our side of asparagus, either. it was so thick. i am sure some people like that, but it was literally over a half an inch thick, and i hate it. i prefer skinnier asparagus, as the fat kind is very difficult to cook the whole way though. so, i didn\\'t really have any veggies to go with my steak.\\n\\nthe server we had and my bartender were both very nice and attentive, but i just don\\'t see any way in hell that our meal was worth $400.00. the experience wasn\\'t spectacular, the food didn\\'t blow me away, and i left feeling guilty that my husband\\'s boss had just spent so much money on something so underwhelming., not really impressed.\\n\\ncame here on a weekday night for a dinner. it\\'s located right in center city - lots of foot traffic and low on parking. \\n\\nit was a nice evening weather wise, so i parked a few blocks south and walked my way over. \\n\\ninside it\\'s dark and and plush. it\\'s got an old school cigar room vibe, where a 1920s gangster meeting might happen.\\n\\nthe menu is your standard steakhouse fare with a seafood slant. there are some modern day options, but nothing exceptionally vegetarian friendly. \\n\\ni ordered a starter salad to begin the meal. it was essentially a bed of lettuce with a few halved cherry tomatoes. i added some bits of the bread they had served for the table as some makeshift \"croutons\", but overall it was a sad dish.\\n\\nfor my meal, i got a plate of roasted veggies, with mashed potatoes on the side. i felt like my whole dish was a collection of sides. some veggies were better prepared than others - i liked the way the brussel sprouts and asparagus were handled. the rest (broccoli, spinach, etc.) were tasteless. the mashed potatoes were decent, but nothing i haven\\'t had before. overall, it wasn\\'t that satiable of a meal. \\n\\nfor dessert i ordered their chocolate mousse. this was a welcomed change to the otherwise forgettable meal. it was light and whipped well. great chocolate flavor without it being too sweet or too bitter.\\n\\nin the end, this is a place for non vegetarians. i feel the company i was with enjoyed their meal more-so than myself. \\n\\ni won\\'t be rushing back here as i feel it does not have menu options that i would enjoy., it\\'s 4:30pm on a saturday night reservations for 20 at 5:30pm at a restaurant in downtown philly.  we are celebrating our daughters wedding and immediate family is on their way. 7 in from florida and texas.   restaurant calls  and says they have a water main break and have to cancel.  panic!  the brides a mess. thought call morton\\'s, we get steve mcgrath on the phone, he asked for 5 minutes,calls back and problem solved.  menu has bride and grooms name on it, selection filet, strip and salmon.  the food and service spectacular.  thank you morton\\'s, thank you steve., my husband and i love morton\\'s. it\\'s definitely one of the best steak houses we go to on a regular. unfortunately, we decided to go there one night with out making a reservation and the 2 girls at the front desk said \"they weren\\'t taking walk ins.\" in the meantime, there are several tables open. my husband and i decide to go to the bar for a drink while i look on open table and not\\nto my surprise,  we find several tables that were available after 30 minutes. we had to book our reservation through open table, while sitting there at the bar, since \"they weren\\'t taking walk ins\" to me this is incredibly poor service on their part. the correct answer should have been, we don\\'t have anything available at this time, but we do here at this time. anyway, when our reservation time came, we walked up to tell them. they said they would get us when it\\'s ready. 15 minutes go by still nothing, while we literally see 5 open tables. finally, i go back up there and complain and they say they had to wait for the other people in front of us to be seated, but there wasn\\'t anyone!!! the food and waiter we had were excellent as expected, the service at the front door is the worse i\\'ve ever seen, i\\'m simply writing this in hopes someone in management sees this post and does something about the complete ignorance we had to deal with., not my cup of tea. something was missing in the atmosphere, not a fun place. our waiter was not smiling at all ( as if he was forced to work or something ) and i made it my target to make him smile before we get the check. food, you can find better with that price or even less. so if the service is not over the top, the ambiance is suffocating and the food is ok why would i go back. i was there 4 years ago and never again.\\ntwo yelps!, a new year\\'s eve disaster!!! the night was a comedy of errors at morton\\'s. it started off at the menu stage where 3 out of the 4 of us had a different card listing the specials. in fact, 2 of us ordered the hearts of palm salad, only to find out that  it was \"temporarily\" unavailable. in fact, this was included in the summer special menu and should have never been offered. i guess temporary means 6 months! when the appetizers arrived, an escargot appetizer had 3 out of the 6 escargots were missing and we had a 10 minute wait for a shrimp cocktail! (10 minutes for pre-peeled shrimp?). the tomato and mozzarella salad, came without tomatoes. the high point of the meal was the steak, which were the only items delivered together correctly. this was quickly squashed by the cold lava cake (which contained what looked more like nutella) and coffee with no sugar in sight. the gm made 2 visits to the table and apologized profusely. he only charged us for the 3 bottles of wine we had. this was a nice gesture that will lead to another visit. i\\'ve eaten at many morton\\'s across the country and this was the worst by far. i hope they can get thier kitchen under control to make this a fine dining establishment once again., for such a pricey and hyped restaurant, my expectations were much higher. i was here for a group dinner (about 60 of us), so we had a prix fixe menu with open bar. that said, i have been to about 20 of these prix fixe dinners around the country over the past year, and this one stands out as the most unassumingly terrible. \\n\\nappetizers - only good one was the crab cake. bread was hard and stale, not enough for our table\\nwine service - slow, ended too early\\nmain course - filet mignon, extremely overcooked, i\\'m talking well-done to the point where it was difficult to cut and dry to eat. i\\'m usually a medium-well kind of guy, and this steak was rubber.\\nsides - actually surprisingly good. loved the mash and the asparagus, ate most of it because the steak was so bad\\ndessert - had a raspberry tart of some sort. way too sweet, portion was bigger than my actual main course. \\n\\ni did leave the restaurant full, but not satisfied., i had dinner with my wife at morton\\'s on our 42nd wedding anniversary . we went there as i heard it was very good. let me tell you, it\\'s not. i ordered surf and turf and my steak was cooked so much i couldn\\'t eat it. i also had horseradish mashed potatoes and found a huge piece of raw potato in the middle. in addition my lobster tail was so mushy that i didn\\'t know if it was bad or raw . never again will i eat at morton\\'s,  as i was very disappointed . by the way this was the morton\\'s in philadelphia ., very disappointed!    loved mortons but tonight not so much.  we had a hair on our table & instead of changing the table cloth or moving us, the waiter picked up with his hand then touched our plates!  then the potato side dish was cold!  it was restaurant week and we ate from that menu and i feel because we ate from the special menu , we were treated like second class citizens.  next time we will patronize one of the other steakhouses in center city!, the food was delicious but and it\\'s a big but, my husband and i ordered two 2 1/2 lbs lobsters and we totally received 1 split lobster.  we felt we were chipped.  the reason they gave us was sometimes a lobster doesn\\'t come with a full claw, never heard of that.  the manager came out and we got some claw meat but it was the meat they put in the bisque.  it tasted once frozen and not from another fresh lobster.  totally over priced, our bill came out to 281.00.  not a huge fan., went for restaurant week first the bartender was downright rude and miserable.  guess he didn\\'t feel like working.  our waiter was ok, but drop the food and run. never do you need another drink, can i get you anything, drop the dessert runs away. no can i get you coffee, had to ask 2 bussers to get the waiter for coffee and finally stopped a pleasant server who got the coffee.  i get it it\\'s restaurant week, but we all had apps,  bottles of wine, etc so it wasn\\'t cheap but i can say i won\\'t be returning.  do yourself a favor, get a new bartender and remind your wait staff their tip is dependent upon service.  we left him 20% but most of the table didn\\'t want to, only reason i stepped foot in here was because i won a $100 gift card from a work event.  and somehow it was still overpriced.  and sucky.  technical term.\\n\\ninterior is weird, have to go up stairs, greeted by a dark-haired  version of donatella versace and man in a nice suit to offer i guess an air of exclusivity, get seated in a gaudy half-empty dining room at 7pm on a weekend night amongst the type of crowd you\\'d see at dave & busters, geno\\'s, or old country buffett but wearing their nicest cargo shorts and tucked-in union-sponsored polos.  but props to the old lady next to us for having a place in the city to spend her rewards points from the golden nugget in ac.  corporate cohesion!\\n\\nmeal starts with a full loaf of bread for the two of us to share.  sweet, onion bread too.  everything bagel-esque.  but, uh, how do you cut it?  it\\'s a big loaf.  do we tear at it with our hands like neanderthals?  cut it, cause burnt onion stuff to be strewn about?  aren\\'t we supposed to be acting civilized in here?\\n\\nwe both got a filet, and i added some shrimps and bacon-wrapped scallops.  fancy!  not really.  medium filet was charred on the outside, burnt flavor overpowered the whole thing.  bacon was raw, shrimp were the sort of thing you buy pre-packaged with cocktail sauce at acme for $15 on your way to your grandmas house, and asparagi were not seasoned at all.  added two glasses of ok wine at like $17/each and some fries and this cost put one back $175+.  i get that steakhouses are expensive, but i should at least get a better meal than what i can make at home in less than the time i spent at this place.\\n\\nservice was nice, though.  poor fella., sadly this place has seen better days!  what used to be impeccable service and wonderful food has become high end controlled mediocrity !!!\\n\\nthe service is just okay,  the environment is old and pretentious almost drab and shabby.   the food is just over priced and average at best.  i really hate to say it but you could almost get the same food and service at longhorn steak for half the price!!!, i don\\'t get it. i would rather drive 15 minutes to nj and spend my hard earned money at whole foods or wegmans in princeton. mccaffrey\\'s has what i consider a small selection of gourmet items but nothing worth the price tag it costs to shop there.  the store itself, needs a facelitft. it is strange because the front of store (where you enter) looks nice (like a kings market in nj) but the rest of the store is unattractive and dated. \\n\\nthe most bizarre part of the whole shopping experience is the crowd. there were a few affluent older woman there who apparently didn\\'t feel as though they needed to be considerate of other shoppers. i don\\'t get it. because they are paying more for their groceries entitles them to be rude?? i literally had an older woman push her shopping cart right into my hip, look at me and then say \"well, are you going to move your cart?\" \\nyou are in a grocery store for christ\\'s sake not the red carpet honey., i was sent to this store by a volunteer at a nearby church. they said they have a working relationship with this store. today  i bought coffee there. a small for 1.05 then after i drank it  3 or 4 emplyees followed me outside and demanded to look inside my purse. now this is illegal and constitutes illegal search and seizure and is a violation of your constiutional rights.  i asked them for their names and they declined.  i asked them what was taken and they did not answer.  what kind of people are they?   why are they slandering people around them ? or are you just accused because you are displaced.  if they were fired tomorrow would they want to be treated this way.  i think this is advoates for the homeless doing with., all i can say is thank god shop rite is coming to yardley.  over and over and over priced and not in a whole foods kind of way. don\\'t waste your time! drive to whole foods or trader joe\\'s!  way too pricey for weekly shopping!, nice store but the staff seems unhappy. very unfriendly folks over at prepared foods. that pizza guy is miserable. i went there the other day at almost 12:30 to do some shopping and get a couple of slices. there was no pizza out! at lunchtime! i tried to communicate with the pizza guy and all i got was a frown and something unintelligible. i think i\\'ll get my pizza at villa rosa and groceries at shoprite. too bad!, it\\'s almost impossible to preorder from the grill. i love the cheese steak but decided to take my business elsewhere.  every time i call nobody will pick up the phone. if the pizza guy receives the call he will immediately put you on hold.  i stopped ordering pizza because the manager (miserable older guy) has the worst attitude i\\'ve ever experienced. it\\'s as if he is doing the customer a favor.  guess management will figure it out soon as de lorenzo\\'s opens!  obviously mccaffrey\\'s isn\\'t serious about pizza with the joker they have managing the pizza department., people who work in princeton store think they are so wonderful and superior because they work in princeton. bet if they checked their own iq\\'s they would realize they aren\\'t princeton material at all!   service is awful. i have been going here for the past several years basically because i like their meat. now the meat is not what it used to be. it has gone down-hill.  used to ask for thin chicken cutlets and get them. now they are thick and awful.  prepared food aren\\'t anything to write home about.  their little salad/lunch and breakfast bar have food i wouldn\\'t give the dog. it\\'s mighty awful. only think i can say that is positive about this place is that the cashiers (most of them) are extremely nice. thanks betty, amber and melissa for being courteous cashiers. \\ndoing much better now shopping at whole foods. at least the people care and are helpful! some of the managers in princeton need to take a course in manners! (except for mark), too overpriced. basically this is a step above acme. acme is cheaper than here and thats saying a lot. i gave em 2 stars because i do like their deli section though., called the store requesting closing time of the liquor store. so called employee notifies me it\\'s 8 pm. after rushing to get to the store, the employee at the liquor store tells me they don\\'t close until 9. get your act together, i get it, small town whatever, you get new yorkers coming through. keep it moving and train your employees., i had an extremely horrible experience at this location. the customer service was terrible in the bakery. the manager of the bakery seemed miserable as well. very disappointed with this location. i\\'m going to stick to the blue bell one. i felt as though i should warn otherss., just moved to the area, so i decided to visit mccaffrey\\'s. found it way overpriced, staff super unfriendly. one of the items i bought was a salad dressing, when i went to open it i saw the the best by date was august 17, 2017! sorry, not worth the convenience, wawa is what it is. a convenient store that has an array of options.\\n\\nthe prices are reasonable. their food is only okay though. i\\'ve had their sandwiches a few times. my biggest gripe is i do not like their tomatoes. i think they freeze them and as a result they are always a little hard. i could be wrong about the reason, but they are hard none-the-less.\\n\\nthey also have a few pre-made hot items. the hot dogs are okay. but it\\'s hard to mess up a hot dog. they hot breakfast sandwiches and snack items are below average. cheap and quick but so not worth it.\\n\\ngo hear for a candy bar, drink, or other package snack item. don\\'t go here for anything that\\'s actually prepared by them. it\\'s just not that good., worst wawa ever. it\\'s filthy. being filthy isn\\'t even the worst part of this store. the worst part is the customer service, or lack there of. the employees here act as if they are being forced to work....and they ain\\'t happy about it. i went to the cashier to pay and since i didn\\'t receive a greeting, i extended one myself. nothing. no hello, no goodbye, no thanks and have a good day. i find it hard to believe this store can\\'t obtain better employees who aren\\'t angry that they have to come to work at wawa. someone from management may want to clean house., the worst wawa i have ever been to. everything is just placed somewhere. not organized at all for you to be able to go in get what you need and get out. and what really made this wawa my least favorite was the staff. they look like they\\'re dying to get out of there and don\\'t even want to communicate with the customers so no you wouldn\\'t ask anything from them. the lady who made my smoothie forgot to leave her bad attitude home., i don\\'t have a clue why this wawa has 4 stars.  it is the worst wawa i have ever been to.  the bread here is always a couple days old, and i really don\\'t think the staff can read because my order is never prepared correctly.  i always ask for extra mayo on my sadwiches and they always put a tiny little bit on one side of the bread... how is that extra??? the sandwiches are never cut, which i don\\'t understand.  this wawa just sucks a$$ when it comes to making sandwiches.  i used to love wawa but after eating at this one for a couple of years, i rarely order sandwiches now from any wawa.  this is sad because the one in my neighborhood is farely decent.  i have no clue why this wawa is always so packed.  i only go in now for the atm and snacks., decided to break the monotony of home style chicken bites by trying their experimental pot stickers. the filling was palatable, but the skin was analogous to munching on dry cardboard. better stick to the classics, wawa., the staff is appalling. i came here and waited 5 minutes while employees spoke of their sexcapades and wouldn\\'t ring me up. i walked out leaving my sandwich i was so annoyed. i\\'m glad they are open again, i just wish they hired better help., the service here is terrible and they truly take forever getting to your order. i\\'ve gone in here multiple times and each time i wait 25-30 mins waiting on my orders. while i watch people that came in after me get theirs before and most of the time it\\'s an uncomplicated order. the people that work there look at you like your causing an issue when you do ask about your order. they are unpleasant and seem to only want to bullshit while they are there. their customer service is terrible. every wawa i have been to other than this one if they see a customer who has been waiting for a while they ask for their number. these people just looked at us like we were causing an issue or were crazy to want to know about our order. they didn\\'t seem to be concerned and i know places get busy but when you see everyone after you getting their food it\\'s pretty frustrating when they are suppose to be a quick service place. one of the worst wawa\\'s i have ever been too. and by the time we did get our food it was already cold. a flatbread and a panini took 30 mins and sat for probably 15 because no one working there wanted to check to see if it was done when asked about it. just would tell us they are working on it but yet when asked again 10 mins later it was already done and they tried to say they called it out when my boyfriend and i were waiting there the whole time. and it was done the whole time., all i wanted was a buffalo chicken cheesesteak. so much so that i walked 5 minutes each way in the rain for it. missing the buffalo...(this was a few weeks ago. it just posted. yes i\\'m petty.), awful, waited 2 and a half hours for my order and then they had an attitude when i asked why is it taking so long. wouldnt recommend this wawa to anyone., the lines are always extremely long and the customer service here has never been great, but at least i was able to get tasty food. this most recent visit, i tried the mac and cheese and a small hoagie, but i was extremely disappointed. the sandwich was thrown together, the mac and cheese was completely flavorless with a dollop of ranch dressing not even mixed in, and the 5 nuggets of chicken they give you don\\'t taste like much either. also the new salad bowls are pretty much more expensive versions of a gas station salad. i added bacon and they added only 4 tiny crumbled bits. lettuce doesn\\'t taste the freshest., terrible service. store is busy and easily crowded. huge lines at 2cashiers, 12 people plus (1120 am, not lunch rush yet). left my stuff., today i was attempting to purchase several items at this store but there weren\\'t any carts at the entrance or the rest of the store,and the cashier was busy.  since i was carrying a shopping bag to pick up an amazon order down the street,i used this to place my items. seconds later an employee literally ran over and quite loudly asked what i was doing. at first i thought he was there to help because i dropped a can. mind you the store was busy and i was surrounded by customers during this time.once again,loud enough for the store to hear,he told me it looked like i was stealing. by then security arrived as well as someone who looked like the manager. i was eventually handed a cart someone found in the back. i did notice the other customers did not have a cart,so i wonder how many did  this store actually own. security was at the door after i paid for my items. security wasn\\'t present on arrival. i started to go corporate with my complaint ,but i will give the manager the benefit of the doubt since i was not given the same respect. to the manager...the proper thing to have done was place security at the door,and then observe to see if i would have paid for the items. even though i work for the university where this store is located ,i will no longer patronize this store. in fact,this is the only wawa store i have ever frequented that did not have shopping carts  at the entrance. my only request is for you and your employees to show respect to someone else that may find themself under the same circumstance., this sore is getting \"older\". it appears that they don\\'t like to put money back into this building. i understand this is a discount store and the margins are more then likely low but even still..... they have mostly off brand name items and only a few selections of most products. so, you won\\'t need to worry about making a decision on which canned corn you\\'re gonna purchase. the turnover rate of cashier seems high as well. it seems they are forever advertising help wanted for that position., aldi means low pricce; but  on certain types  of toilet paper,  price label is always wrong in every store ;  sometimes  $2  to $4 overcharge;   after 6months, same issue at another store;  \\n   ///////////, i was happy to find gluten free \"pad thai rice noodle bowl\" as this weeks aldi find as i have a gf mate, till i made it. the instructions stated to, drain well after noodles become soft, but firm. empty sauce & vegetables over noodles, microwave one min on high then enjoy. there was no joy, what you are then left with is a stuck together, gooey wad of sadness.  i was lucky enough that about a 1/4 of the water i drained off landed in a clean bowl that was in the sink and was added back into the glop in hopes of freeing it up. even with adding soy sauce and chopped green onion it was still just above gruel. i bought 2 so the second one, when i get the nerve to try it will get a cup of chicken stock/broth added back after the water draining., my husband and i frequented *ndulge cupcake boutique at there state college location. the year we graduated, *ndulge closed its doors and relocated to the philadelphia area. upon moving to the area we were excited to come across the business and decided to take a visit. we were completely disappointed! the two female staff that were present were unfriendly and had awkward attitudes which created an extremely uncomfortable environment. one of the female staff did not even address me in conversation and was only speaking to and making eye contact with my husband.\\n\\nthe case had a very small selection of cupcakes that didn\\'t look appealing in terms of display or design. they were sparsely frosted with no special garnishes. we bought four different kinds and they all lacked some sort of quality component. the only thing pistachio about the \"chocolate moussetachio\" was the pistachio on top of the cupcake. the other cupcakes were extremely dry and dense and either had sparse filling or were over filled to the point where we had to scoop dollops of filling out. the term boutique implies sophistication and specialty. the cupcakes here are far from being boutique quality and aren\\'t anything special.save your time and your money and seek out another cupcake shop., this place was a huge disappointment.  it was quite an unwelcoming atmosphere and i swear on my life i am keeping my manayunk/roxborough businesses to other places that are not only more welcoming, but also just as good, it not better.\\n\\nmf and i walk in with checkers, a caged small mammal.  we\\'re by the door picking out a flavor for the three of us.  so we\\'ve decided that florida key lime was the only one that looked appealing.  well, the manager approaches us and the very first question she asks was, \"is that a cat in there?\"  so we\\'re standing there thinking to ourselves, \"oh, is she severely allergic to cats?\"\\n\\nwell, it wasn\\'t a cat.  i don\\'t know if that\\'s a good or bad thing.  if it were a cat, would we have been able to get a bloody key lime cupcake to go without having to be booted out to their stoop?\\n\\n1. she says it\\'s the philadelphia health department policy.  fair enough, but then why did it matter if it was a cat or not?  it sure as hell was not a service animal.  if the first thing she said was, \"i apologize, but we don\\'t allow animals,\" this place would be okay in my book. nope, she wanted to know the species first.  so what pissed me off was the way she framed it.   she had a discriminatory tone.  that was the deal breaker.\\n\\n2.  she says we can wait outside (in the rain) and she\\'ll bring the stuff out to us.  what is this, lady and the tramp?  a caged small mammal at outside seating is more sanitary than a dog sitting there with a leash, who is still free to defecate and urinate on the restaurant sidewalk.  \\n\\n3.  we went to two other food places prior and ordered stuff to go, and no one else had an issue.\\n\\ni understand that there are federal regulations one must be in compliance with.  it\\'s the way i was approached.  i felt like my baby was bullied., not anywhere close to as good as i wanted it to be.  in fact, not that good at all.  two stars instead on one because the place is new looking and in good shape.  however, the staff was not super friendly, nor was the cupcake selection that good.  i\\'ll have to try the gelato another occasion, so i can\\'t judge that.\\n\\ni had a cream soda cupcake, that was really just a crappy cupcake with cream soda jelly beans on top.  a dry cake with an overly sweet frosting.  honestly, it was borderline gross.   \\n\\nthere is a much better option for cupcakes and sweets in the area, so i think i\\'ll stick to them.  plus, the other place does cakes which ndulge does not.  i have family who lives in the area of their other location, and they too complained about the quality of the cupcakes.  \\n\\ni think competition is good for manayunk, and two places to get cupcakes is good, however i can not vouch for the quality of this place.  i\\'ll go else where for an all around great experience., this food is poison. the amount of oil in the fries would eventually kill a human being. this is disgusting to say the least., i had high hopes for benna\\'s west, i love the mural on the interior wall and the vibe of the place but the food was a big let down. i\\'ve never been one to leave a negative review but here it goes. i ordered the praline french toast which was served cold.\\n\\ni gave the staff a heads up about it, to which they asked if i wanted a refund. once i said i wasn\\'t interested in my money back, but just wanted to give them a heads up their concern seemed to end. not the response i had hoped for. might check back in a few months but on the whole it was a bummer for sure., coffee was not good in my opinion. overpriced as well. it\\'s nothing personal but for taste it is very overpriced. i won\\'t be planning on going back. i did get a bagel from where though and it wasn\\'t bad. \\n\\n\\nservice wasn\\'t bad, just that the coffee was., in town visiting a friend who suggested this was a good place to grab a quick breakfast on the go. walked in, server was with customer at register, did not greet us (understsndable) but continued to talk with customer for several minutes, never addressed us and when a new customer walked in they were serviced right away, like we were invisible. we left. very disappointing., just had a really unpleasant experience with who i can only presume was the owner of the place. unbeknownst to me, this bennas serves food such as breakfast sandwiches. the other bennas in the hood do not. i had brought in a breakfast sandwich from another place based on that misunderstanding. i ordered my coffee and water at the counter and explained to then my misunderstanding, to which no one lodged any objections. settling down for what was about to be a 10-12 dollar day for them. after i had begun eating, the owner came over and said that she couldn\\'t allow that even after i explained to her why i brought the food in. \\nshe wasn\\'t having it. coffee returned, another unsatisfied customer out the door forever. they deserve the awful reputation that they have in the neighborhood. \\ni guess 1 star is the lowest you can go on this site, i\\'ve actually never written a review before. but if i could give zero stars i would., counter staff wasn\\'t friendly. food is way overpriced, over 6$ for a tiny bagel sandwich with three ingredients. baguette was the only other choice for bread and it was like chewing through a rock. everything was cramped, tables weren\\'t cleaned. coffee was bland. internet was restricted and unable to connect to any school websites. will never go to bennas again!!!!, i hate to give 1 star but benna\\'s needs to learn somehow. i have not gone into benna\\'s once without having something wrong with my order. i\\'ve given them multiple shots to get it right and nope. last time i asked for a bagel with cream cheese and i got home  - no cream cheese. that is literally the easiest order ever.  another time i got home and opened my coffee and it was full of spoiled milk. i walked all the way back just to have them tell me \"it\\'s supposed to be like that\". also - a bacon, egg and cheese comes with half of a slice of bacon. they also don\\'t take cards and the last time i was in there the atm machine was broken. cool. i love supporting local businesses and i will support benna\\'s in the future if they get their act together., i really hate leaving a bad review but today we had a bad experience. first my husband\\'s breakfast order was wrong. they put bacon on his croissant sandwich. they couldn\\'t make another one because it was the last croissant and we were running late. so they offered us a refund of $6 and change with no apology. then about 5 minutes later my breakfast baguette sandwich came out and much to my dismay, i had paid an extra $2 for one small piece of bacon. seriously? the only good thing about the sandwich was the baguette. we were originally so excited about this local place, but i can\\'t justify stupidly high prices and bad customer service., waited nearly 30 minutes for a bagel, while my friend\\'s order was accidentally made and brought out twice. i was going to order a latte, but one glance at the espresso machine and the general state of the coffee counter and i quickly changed my mind. the two stars are for their significant number of vegan options, but don\\'t go if you have somewhere to be anytime soon. for coffee, just walk the extra few blocks to ultimo. you\\'ll thank me., just changed the name but i feel as though nothing else has changed....i want to like this place so bad- the food and coffee has always been good but the service is another story. no matter the time of day it always takes forever to get served no matter how many people are in line. it would be in their best interest to hire another staff to help during busy hours and that might make things a little bit easier., really watery coffee. not very enthusiastic or helpful barista. atmosphere is cute and convenient. dissapointj, $26.30 for two bagel breakfast sandwiches and two 16 oz. smoothies. yes, you read that right.\\n\\ni want to like this place. really, i do. because i live a block and a half away, and it would be so convenient to have a reliable cafe option this close. \\n\\nbut this isn\\'t it. i mean, the food and drinks are decent enough. but not worth the exorbitant prices you pay. and oftentimes, the bored hipster staff can\\'t be bothered to get your order right in the first place. on several occasions they have \"forgotten\" to swap out the soy milk for almond milk in smoothies i\\'ve ordered. not a big issue for me, but a huge one for my gf, who has a soy allergy and thus had more than one upset stomach thanks to their carelessness. \\n\\ni finally reached my tipping point this past weekend. it wasn\\'t only paying through the nose for an order that, again, wasn\\'t quite accurate. it was running to their house atm mid-checkout, after realizing i was a few dollars short, and coming back and seeing a sign that says they now take credit cards--a fact the bored cashier didn\\'t mention at any point in the transaction, even when i was frantically scrambling at the atm. any normal cashier should say, \"hey, we take cards now if you want to pay that way.\"\\n\\nsorry, benna\\'s. i don\\'t care how much in a hurry i am, and how convenient you are. you\\'re just not worth it., please benna\\'s, i desperately want you to be one of my local main squeezes but the consistency has to be more on point and compared to other local coffee shops your prices are way high. $3.00 for a tiny muffin is too steep compared to the giant muffins you can get on passyunk for the same or less money plus i\\'m sorry to say that your muffins and lemon cake slices are hard and dry on more occasions than not (again, a consistency issue). i know all your places have the same kind of plastic wrapped up pastries but if your going to charge that much then they have to always be fresh and bigger for those prices. it\\'s hit or miss on the consistency on all areas, the pastries, the bagel sandwiches and the mixed coffee drinks. one day my latte is perfect, the next i have to add gobs of sugar.  \\nlastly, i hate having to yell my order to the person taking my order b/c the music is so incredibly loud all the time, half the time they don\\'t hear me say \"please fill, i don\\'t use cream\" and then i\\'m left standing there with the choice of handing it back saying, can you please top it off, i don\\'t use cream or walking away with a 3/4 filled cup of coffee. i never want to hand it back b/c it\\'s not like they look at me lovingly like sure, no problem, our fault, no...it\\'s an annoyed look from the unhappy tattooed girl who works the counter in the mornings, pleasant she is not., this place has gone to trash since it sold. i went in today after a while of not having been there. i know there have been some changes so i was giving it another chance. i went it and saw the philly breakfast sandwich which sounded awesome. the girl at the counter proceeds to tell me that they only have a cinnamon raisin muffins left. i asked for the sandwich on a long roll and she said they had been discontinued. i informed her that the shops probably not have it listed on the board. her response was that it was only discontinued yesterday. respect your customers enough to at least have a sign up or cross it out. don\\'t tell me it\\'s hard to change the board. for as much money as i\\'ve spent here since i\\'ve lived in south philly, you\\'d think one could be treated better. please give your new hires a course on good customer service. bitter coffee and elitism can only get you so far., i went here when if first opened, and have never desired to go back again, i was so very disappointed at the quality and the taste of the food. i would absolutely not recommend dining here., the service here was good.  its the food that will prevent me from returning. the veal parm was dried out and tasteless....come on, this is an italian place, veal parm should be a go-to at any italian place!  i then noticed another yelp reviewer had the same experience. they did take it off our bill and the managers were very happy we shared the feedback., always wanted to visit this restaurant since the outside made it seem inviting and fancy. finally saw the inside and did not expect it to look like a plain, old building. wasn\\'t impressed. came here for lunch on a friday and the service was slow and disorganized. it wasn\\'t even busy. the food didn\\'t make it any better. it was mediocre at best. this will be my first and last time. i\\'ll give two stars since you get free bread, but doesn\\'t almost every italian spot do that?, a need to understand customer service. very disappointed with the lack of understanding. traveling down from ny to take my mother to a musical at the media theater. picked mom up at the nursing home. looking to get a reservation at one of my mom\\'s favorite testaruants.  unfortunately the person on the phone wouldn\\'t accommodate a reservation for our party of 4. they only take reservations for large parties. silly, standard food, poor service. i went with my family (5 top) and we were one of 3 tables there for dinner (it was memorial day). our server was not only slow, but her was unfriendly. i\\'ve been a server so i understand a slow kitchen may not be a server\\'s fault, but he was very rude. he would drop off a drink or bread and not say a word. multiple times we tried to ask him for something but he ran away from our table so quickly that he didn\\'t hear (or acknowledge) us. the food is good--nothing so good that i would say the wait and poor service were worth it. the waiter didn\\'t even say goodby to us. a bit disappointed., attending \"dining under the stars\" in media this past wednesday night. what a great experience. the dining experience on the other hand, not so much. \\n\\nour waiter was rude and pushy/rushy. i will give him the benefit of the doubt, although we had our reservations at 8:45 and looking around, it didn\\'t seem to be that \"busy\".\\n\\ni ordered the gnoicchis with red meat sauce. specifically asking for them to be cooked firm. he assured us that is how they are made. come to find out, they were not. in fact, they had a texture like mashed potatoes. \\n\\nwould not recommend., i went to this location for the first time just recently. the reason we decided to go to this location was because were given a gift card. i have been buy this restaurant many times but never a desire to go in. overall i was not impressed with this restaurant. i had the chicken parmesan and it was not the greatest. i also felt the service was very slow and disorganized. do not have an interest to visit spasso in media, i feel there are better options in media., we didnt actually make it to dinner. they screwed up our reservation so badly, we left. never a good place at that location, unfortunately., i was not impressed . i ordered take out, i arrived and there sat my order on a table not under a heat lamp .. myself being in the industry i would thing one would keep orders warm but mines sat on a table cold  as i took it and paid for it yeah i\\'m sure i wouldn\\'t be coming back!!!!, if i could give it zero stars i would. stopped in there after the parade thinking it was a good spot to eat. when the parade was going on there was a lot of people eating outside so i figured it was good. we went during brunch which was good, who doesn\\'t like a good brunch? the server came right over to take our drink order which was good. then they came back for are order fine. it took close to an hour for us to receive our food. there had to be at least 10 or more staff working. to me they seemed more concerned with the people eating outside then inside. a group of people left because of not being served. miraculously when i asked where our food was it showed up. the server told us it takes longer to cook because it is brunch? how long does it take to make eggs???? i would not go back it\\'s a shame it has a nice setting to it but service was horrendous., horrible experience here. first off, they seated us in the basement. second, there was a poor menu selection. we just got up and walked out. waitress never came to our table. with all of the open tables upstairs they still chose to put us in the basement., over priced quality and portions have shrunk. shame it use to be good. now only they rich and naive cant eat here. you will be rapped here for subpar food., food was warm, spaghetti sauce was way too sugary, bread was too hard, butter was frozen- don\\'t waste your money here., sorry -- just not good. i have finally created a yelp account just for spasso. went on a sunday for some wine and small plates. the hostess greeted us with seeming confusion that patrons were looking to be seated. after some group consultations, the staff settled on a room in which to place us.\\n\\nthe wines by the glass are listed solely by varietal, not by vintner or winery. so i had the unknown riesling. sweeter and fruitier than expected, but with no other markings, expectations were unfounded, i suppose.\\n\\nwe ordered arancini, grilled calamari, cold antipasto plate, and broccoli rabe. arancini: fine, but not as good as ariano a couple of blocks away. the sauce was reasonably good. some pathetic lettuce leaves were presented nearby. calamari: kind of scorched, and absolutely tasteless. antipasto: basically everything you could get from a jar from the fridge: marinated mushrooms, a coupe of slices of deli salami, some dry end slices of prosciutto (really, how do you mess up this fine product?), again some wilted and sad pieces of lettuce, some slices of fresh mozzarella that were really not special, and some roasted red peppers that were from a big food service jar. finally, the broccoli rabe was also pretty bland. not much garlic, kind of soggy, not well seasoned, and nothing to entice you. presentaiton is about a 0 out of 9 too -- the arancin were just rolling around a big plate, and the calamari were just slapped on a big dinner plate all alone.\\n\\nit was all disappointing. these are supposed to be the tasty delicacies that constitute italian cooking. instead, we could have taken our money across the street to trader joe\\'s and gotten fresher, better versions of the same items.\\n\\npositives: fast service (even those next to us who ordered full dinners at the same time got it in no time), convenient location, nice building. (then again, this building hasn\\'t housed a serviceable restaurant in the 12 years we\\'ve been in the area.) dinner dishes might be a lot better. and maybe the b team gets sundays. but, this time, simple appetizers were uniformly disappointing; we regret having tried this place at all., my husband and i had an early dinner here yesterday for our anniversary.  i didn\\'t have huge expectations; but it was pretty disappointing.  we started with the shrimp cocktail and caprese salad.  the shrimp dish contained 5 jumbo shrimp, but they were definitely not fresh.  pretty dry actually.  and at $3 per piece of shrimp, i expect pretty nicely cooked shrimp.  the mozzarella in the caprese salad was nothing special.  the tomato tasted refridgerated and like a grocery store tomato.  for entrees, i got the crab ravioli.  it was good, but not great.  where i really fault the restaurant is my husband\\'s grilled shrimp entree.  i noticed right away that the shrimp had not been deveined . i mentioned it to my husband, who then had to hack away at the shrimp to remove the veins (i.e., waste matter).  this to me was inexcusable.  our server was a nice young man, but he asked if we wanted another drink; we said yes; then we never got our drinks until long after we finished eating.  there are much better restaurants in media.  we had wanted to try spasso for some time, but we won\\'t be back., went with three girlfriend for restaurant week. despite having a reservation, we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated. the restaurant was nearly empty except one room where they were shoving all the restaurant week people. that makes no sense to me... since the restaurant week special was an option how did they know we were going to be doing that special??? the room was hot, had no circulation, and extremely loud. it took them almost 2.5 hours to serve our whole meal. the appetizer was good, the macaroni course was eh (pasta was way al dente, borderline not fully cooked), and my entree... well, the peas were still frozen.  i honestly will probably not be back. it\\'s a shame. but there are better places on state street., after my 2nd disappointing visit here i\\'m confident to say the food is sub par, my first experience here i ordered the veal porcini which was drenched and soggy from the runny sauce. tonight i was hoping to enjoy the crab ravioli, the first two were decent, but when i put the 3rd one into my mouth i was overwhelmed with a taste of foulness. i will not be returning., we dined there last week.  it was busy but not a madhouse.  we had drinks at the bar while we waited for a table.  there were 3 bartenders behind a small-to-average sized bar.  it still took 15 minutes to have our order taken and get a drink.  huh?  \\nthe server was nice but inconsistent.  the food was great, but i don\\'t think i would go again.  it didn\\'t compare to the spasso in philly., although our server was attentive and the restaurant\\'s ambiance is breathtaking, i really wish i had listened to the reviews of spasso more and not eaten there....it wasn\\'t worth my curiosity.\\n\\nour reservation was made, and yet, we still waited an extremely long period of time to be seated (we even arrived almost 25 minutes early!). i completely understand being busy - but don\\'t call it a \"reservation\" if you really mean \"call ahead seating\"\\n\\nthe server was attentive and made sure we felt welcome, good job, paul! \\n\\nthe food was beyond \"blah\"...i shouldn\\'t have paid so much for overcooked noodles...no lie, \"overcooked\" is an understatement! \\n\\nmy boyfriend, who was the one who chose spasso, ended up getting sick off of the food and \"losing\" his dinner before the night was through...he kept a smile on his face, but was definitely not feeling the dish. \\n\\nwe had requested separate checks at the beginning of the meal and were told it wasn\\'t possible, but that the staff would \"assist in dividing up the check.\" that was fair enough....however, when the check arrived - it was dropped at the table and the server was gone! there was absolutely no help whatsoever! \\n\\ni am torn between 2 and 3 stars....i liked the atmosphere, i liked the staff\\'s attention, but the food was not worth the deduction in my wallet!, i\\'ve been here several times and it\\'s always been fantastic. last time we went, i was so excited. maybe the normal chef was on vacation, but the food was just okay this time. i ordered the same things i usually do, but the portion sizes were smaller, and they didn\\'t taste nearly as good. my companion didn\\'t really like anything he got. i never caught our waitress\\' name, as she didn\\'t introduce herself, but she seemed pretty inattentive.  she came back ten minutes after serving our food to check on us. when we said it was \"okay\" instead of \"great\" or even \"good\", she walked away. also, we were seated basically on top of another table when the dining room was empty. we left feeling very disappointed., went for dinner last night (saturday) and i ordered the shrimp fra diavolo. the shrimp was a bit off in flavor and was also tough to cut through. not sure if it was cooked frozen or microwaved but it was very bad. sadly the pasta and sauce wasn\\'t much better. the service was very attentive to our needs though., their food is incredibly overpriced and their portions are embarrassing. they don\\'t even offer soup or salad with their entree\\'s, which proves they are greedy pieces of shit. this place is about one notch up compared to olive garden., poor experience the past two visits. restaurant is clean and well maintained so i am rating based off food. my meal gave me severe stomach problems 5 minutes after leaving the restaurant. my dish tasted like a stick of butter on my gnocchi. for the price, i was not impressed . definitely will not return / done with this restaurant after the serious bowel issues i had after eating here . sorry for the tmi, the last time we ate here for an anniversary i left hungry and irritated because our meal was not food. i had the gnocchi and it was like sticks of butter , gross. before i made it home my stomach curled over in pain- made me sick !!! i couldn\\'t stop throwing up, this has to be the most disorganized restaurant in media. my family and i are are sitting outside in the beer garden enjoying some beverages. god forbid we order food. it seems like a request they cannot handle. \\n\\nfirst, they provide us with both a beer garden and a  lunch menu. we are told by the waitresses we have to order at the bar. why?  we go to the bar, and told we need to order inside at the bar. then we are informed we have the wrong menus. the bartender inside is confused as well as she does not understand why we had to come inside, but accommodated us well. \\n\\nguess what - your customers do not understand either. what are the purposes of the waitresses outside?  geez, it\\'s not that hard when you have every table occupied that you need waitresses outside!!, went in last night for dining under the stars. my son and i did not have a reservation. we opted to sit at a high top in the bar area after learning from the hostess that they would be begin shutting down outside dining (i asked) in 20 minutes. we waited over 10 minutes for service and the person who took our drink order was not our waiter.  during this time, i observed the hostess seating new guests outside, which annoyed me.  i recognize that staff gets busy, but not paying attention to your section or saying a quick  hello to a new table is a big no-no. i usually leave when this happens,  but we were starving, so we stayed put. \\n\\nmy wine seemed underpoured ( i\\'m a former bartender) our mussels red appetizer was poor in that they were dried out and small. our dinners were ok. \\n\\ni will say, our server was very nice, i believe his name was mike. older gentleman, buzz cut and glasses-  good menu knowledge- we had a few questions, engaging w my son, attentive once he began with us. \\n\\ni think if i went back, it would just be for cocktails.  the bar atmosohere is warm and inviting and is very spacious., a perfectly good neighborhood italian restaurant with decent pasta and a comfortable vibe.  it\\'s usually crowded and the food is exactly as you would expect it to be-- no surprises good or bad. \\n\\nthis last visit, as our table was cleared our wine glasses were removed still holding some wine. \\nwhen we complained the server told us he would \"get us next time\". not inspiring.\\n\\n\\nit was fine- we won\\'t be back.  too many other options for good food around., first - very unprofessional service. the wait person rushed us from the first minutes we arrived. toward the end of the meal, she actually pulled the half-finished dinner plate from another guest. she also cleared half of the table and left one diner eating alone. it was some of the least professional service i have ever observed.\\n\\nthe food was fair at best. while edible, it was entirely uninspired and ordinary. we will not return. this place is not cheap. considering everything it is very overpriced., with great anticipation, we went there for dinner saturday night. they don\\'t take reservations so we made sure to get there around 6:30, just as the early birds were leaving. immediately seated at our cramped table, we waited about 10 minutes before our drink order was taken. some 10 or so minutes later, we ordered dinner.\\n\\ni had high hopes for spasso but they were quickly dashed when the appetizers arrived. stuffed artichoke where they used the inedible outer leaves of the artichoke? caesar salad with no anchovies? not an auspicious beginning...\\n\\nour main courses arrived. i got the veal parm. one piece was decent but the other piece was so thin it was way overcooked - looked and felt like cardboard. the accompanying pasta tasted old and was very undercooked. \\n\\nan italian restaurant that cannot cook pasta properly?!?! wow!\\n\\nwine list is cheap and thin. no draft beers. my cosmo was quite good, though.\\n\\nall in all, a very meh meal. i expected more., no thank you.... used to work there,... unless they fixed the dish washing machine i wouldn\\'t eat there if someone paid me no thanks!!!! just saying. not to mention they were very used to playing favoritisms when it came to employees soo some workers did all the work when some ppl made all the money! thanks for reminding me how badly i was treated and after all the hard work i put in was no longer welcomed. i forgot to go and visit yelp reviews have a fantastic day. spend your hard earned money at ariano or fellinis\\'s!!!!!, we have been to spasso multiple times and food/service has always been good. not sure if we\\'ll come back after our recent experience. first we couldn\\'t make a reservation for 2; it was my wife\\'s birthday so we didn\\'t want to have to show up and not have a table ready but we went anyways. showed up and stood by the hostess for at least 1-2 minutes before she looked up and very rudely addressed us. it was a 40 minute wait which was too long but we would have waited had the hostess not been a complete turnoff. she should be fired or at least removed from the front of house. hire someone who represents the restaurant not someone who looks like she\\'d rather be anywhere else and like she hates customers. based on her alone you lost repeat customers., this is a lovely building and the restaurant is quiet enough to have conversations easily. service (zach) was fine. still, the food taste and quality doesn\\'t justify the prices charged. my pappardelle ponconi was too much sauce and poorly cooked pasta. my husband\\'s scallops and spaghetti was distasteful to him. we won\\'t be back., my friends and i decided to go to spasso for the first time last night, during dining under the stars. i called tuesday to see if spasso had anything available for our table of 8 around 7:00. the man who took my call pleasantly assured me they had tables available and advised me to make the reservation for 7:00. although they get busy at that time, they had a couple of reservations at 6 and 6:30 and 7 was best. \\n\\nwe got there around 6:50 and were given a pager and told it would be about 20-25 minutes. a half hour passes and i ask for an update on our table. i was told it wasn\\'t going to be too much longer. we decide to grab a drink at the bar. by the time we get back out it\\'s 7:50 (50 minutes past our reservation time). i update them saying we\\'re down to 6 people because the wait was too long. \\n\\nten minutes later the hostess asks if our party is here. i assure her we were and have been waiting for an hour. we finally get seated at a table for 4 that now had 6 chairs and 6 menus. by 8:45 (45 minutes after we were seated) we still had no silverware or napkins. our food didn\\'t arrive until after 9. our waitress was great, but other than that our service was horrible. the worst part was not once did we get an apology for their poor service until after we asked to speak to a manager when we got our bill. the manager gave a half ass apology claiming she didn\\'t know they\\'d be busy even though the man who took my reservation told me it gets busy at that time.  \\n\\nreservations are pointless, might as well call it call ahead seating. horrible experience. i gave two stars because the food was good. maybe even good enough to justify the higher price, but definitely not worth the wait. i\\'d be willing to try the brunch but certainly never coming to dinner again., celebrated a family member\\'s birthday on june 23rd with 8 guests and the bill was a couple of $100 so as always i leave a 20% tip for the waiter who was pretty good with service. besides the flies interrupting our dinner due to the doors being open the food was excellent and the atmosphere was fun. at the end of the night when the bill was paid i graciously gave 20% as i always do for good service but as i walked out of the restaurant to take pictures in front of the establishment the waiter pete decided he was going to interrupt our photo session and asked if everything was ok to which i advised yes. pete, the waiter, decided he was going to express his concern that i did not leave enough money for a tip for him. astonished as i was i asked him to walk inside since he made that comment in front of family members, guests and customers outside the establishment. i then showed him the receipt and my calculations which he nodded his head and said ok at which time i left with my family. concerned that this was not the proper way to handle the situation i contacted a manager who was in disbelief himself. the manager antonio (i believe) stated that he or a general manager would call me back but at this time no one has returned my call. i was truly upset and embarrassed that this waiter assumed he deserved more than 20%. it appears from other reviews that this waiter pete has had other interactions like this one.  i am shocked that the owners of this establishment continued to allow this to happen and i do not recommend this restaurant to anyone since i see that this has been an ongoing effort by this one waiter. it is a shame that one waiter can ruin the integrity of this establishment., what a mess there today! our party of 5 arrived about 11:30 for sunday brunch. i ordered the carne frittata. our server told us she\\'d bring the food out as it was done so it would be hot. (the place had only 2 or 3 other tables filled at the time.) our server brought mine out last and told me, \"i\\'m so sorry. they are remaking your order and i brought this (seemed to be the egg white omelette) out for you now.\" despite my family prompting me to eat it, i didn\\'t touch it because it wasn\\'t what i wanted. \\n\\neveryone else ate, and were almost done, and our server brought me a salmon frittata (someone else in our party ordered one, but i don\\'t eat fish.) i took it back to her and said that i ordered the carne frittata, and i didn\\'t even want it now because the rest of my party had finished their meal. she came back a few minutes later with the carne frittata!!!  (the table behind us witnessed all of this had already left.) \\n\\ni reminded her that i said i didn\\'t even want it, since everyone else was done eating (and i was really fed up at this point.) we asked for a manager and were told there wasn\\'t one on duty. they chef was handling things.\\n\\nour server was very polite and apologetic, offered dessert (which i declined) and then took our coffees off the order.  i fault spasso having a chef doing double duty for all the screw-ups in this empty restaurant! it\\'s a shame because we\\'ve had very good meals here, and after this morning, i don\\'t think i\\'ll go back!, food was tasty and service was fine, but fair warning, any substitutions to the menu, expect a significant upcharge. my friend asked to sub red sauce with blush, and was charged an additional $3 and i added shrimp to my $9.75 caesar salad and was charged an additional $15 (~$3 per shrimp - $25.50, the cost of their shrimp entree). the waitress was understanding when i questioned the bill and was able to deduct a few bucks after speaking with her manager, but definitely ask questions when ordering! would have never added protein to my salad had i known it would cost more than the meal itself., wasn\\'t really impressed with my experience at spasso. we visited this restaurant on a wednesday night during dining under the stars. very beautiful atmosphere but the service and food was lacking. \\n\\nwhile waiting for a table we took a seat in the beer garden next to the restaurant to get some appetizers. we couldn\\'t even make eye contact with any members of the waitstaff. understandably it was a wednesday in media, however, waiting nearly 30 minutes to place a drink/appetizer order is a bit much. in addition, it almost felt like we were being rushed out of there as soon as we ate. \\n\\nfinally being seated, the food came out in an average amount of time and was that at best. pasta was well undercooked and the chicken parmesan was bland. the linguini and clams was about the same. the linguini just fell apart once in your mouth and had almost a chalky texture. \\n\\nnot bad, but not great either., went there for my husbands birthday and ordered the calamari as an appetizer then when we got it their portion was ridiculous for $13.95 ??!! said something to the waiter but he said oh the portion is 6oz so i believed they probably missed the other 3oz on plate !!!!!, pretty good     the waiter did that thing where he does not right down your order. which is pretty cool if he gets the order right.    but he had to come back 2 times to \"clarify\" the order then sent someone else back a third time because the bottom of the order was \"torn off\". \\n\\nlame!\\n\\nthe food was good but the waiter got it wrong.  one of us was served the wrong antipasti and another received the wrong entrée.  so much for the memory game.     offer him a pencil and paper if he is not writing it down., why did my short rib pappardelle smell like vomit?  perhaps the cheese had gone bad, perhaps it was something else, who knows, but whatever it was, there was no way something that smelled like that should have been allowed to leave the kitchen.  we ordered takeout so unless i wanted to drive back there wasn\\'t much to do about it.  so we tossed it.  problem was, the smell was so bad that we had to then toss the garbage bag into the outdoor can.  oh, well.  \\n\\nthe tiramisu was okay, though., the food here is pretty decent, but service is pretty bad..and by bad i mean horrendous. if you want to eat here i suggest doing take out.\\n\\nafter taking our order our server checked in zero times until we got our check. we even had a pretty big mistake in our order but the server never stopped by once during our meal to check in so we didn\\'t even get a chance to ask! the server stated the special of the night was pasta with shrimp and jumbo scallop for $28, and out came pasta with crab meat. to give credit where credit is due, the pasta was still good but 2 of us specifically ordered the (fake) special because we have an obsession with scallop. but, because our server disappeared off the face of the earth for a 1.5 hour, we just ate our food for sake of time. finally, the busser came to clear our table (yes, we were done but still no sign of our server) and finally we got a chance to ask about the scallop. our server then magically arrived from thin air to apologize for his error; he stated that he had said the special from a different night, and that he would reflect his error on the check.\\n\\nthat almighty apology and reflection of error came out to a discount of fifty cents!!!! a grand spankin total of $1 off our final bill for the 2 plates that we didn\\'t even order at the fault of our server. this is where the word horrendous comes in. \\n\\ni guess we tipped him for his magical disappearing act and ability to trick his customers., i have been a server for years and it takes a lot for me to get angry at a server or strongly dislike a restaurant. we sat down at a high table in the bar area (first come first serve). the restaurant was busy so it was understandable that our server couldn\\'t take the drink order right away, but when our food took over an hour to come out she avoided eye contact with our table. when dinner finally came out, we got a \"sorry the kitchen is really busy.\" \\nwhat really made me angry was after the meal when someone at our table ordered a coffee to go. being in the food service business, i would have never put this $2.75 coffee on the bill as a small gesture of saying thank you for your patience, i\\' m sorry for any inconvenience. \\nthe menu was very limited, the food was ok but everything was very pricey, service was terrible and i would never go back again. i don\\'t recommend this restaurant to anyone., my husband and i eat at spasso often since we moved to middletown three years ago.  lat night we took our son out to celebrate his graduation from college.  we also took our younger son and his girlfriend.  the waiter was friendly enough but our kid\\'s order was a mess.  the two younger ones both ordered fettuccine alfredo but when it arrived, it had shrimp mixed in.  neither one likes shrimp.  no offer was made to bring them new meals.  instead they picked the shrimp out and the waiter brought them some sauteed chicken on a plate.  both said they could still taste the shrimp and didn\\'t eat much.  we took it home to be polite and didn\\'t want to cause a scene.  it was tossed it into the trash.  we\\'ll probably find a new italian restaurant.  btw, they didn\\'t have the ingredients to make my husband\\'s mai tai either so he settled for beer.  very disappointed., i\\'ll start by advising you to take advantage of their monday and tuesday night special:  appetizer, entrée and dessert for $35.  free bottle of wine with every two dinners.\\n\\nunfortunately, this wasn\\'t noted on the menu, or suggested by our waiter.  we noticed the deal online after the fact.\\n\\nspasso ranks below four stars, but because of the two entrees that we enjoyed, i rounded up.  my husband thoroughly enjoyed his chicken fontinella  (fontinella cheese, peppers and asparagus in tomato sauce, served with grilled vegetables and potatoes.)  my chicken saltimbocca (mozzarella, prosciutto, spinach) was delicious.\\n\\nnow for the decline.  linguini and clams was a big disappointment.  devoid of flavor.  rather than the vegetable/potato combo that came with the saltimbocca, i asked for pasta.  again, flavorless and doughy.  garlic, olive oil -- something! -- would have jazzed it up.  our friend who had clams, said the same for her pasta. \\n\\nwe ordered a bottle of chianti that proved mediocre,  and started our meal with caesar salad.  one salad split three ways was enough for a starter.  they give you a gratis plate of caponata with a basket of  italian bread.\\n\\non a nice evening, the front patio is conducive to an al fresco meal (something i always enjoy.)  note that nobody that we saw on staff was masked, despite the surge in covid cases., came here for a work dinner. we were seated in the private meeting room. the customer service here was absolutely exceptional. our waiter was very attentive, refilling our drinks all night and constantly making sure we were taken care of. for appetizers, he brought out an assortment of seafood. the crab cakes were so delicious ! for the main course i ordered the crab meat and shrimp ponza. this was very disappointing ! absolutely no flavor whatsoever! me and one of my colleagues actually  ordered the same thing and we literally went back and forth passing the salt and pepper bottle. according to some other coworkers, they also complained about the lack of flavor in their dishes. i probably would  not go out of my way to eat here again., i am very disappointed with my recent experience. i emailed the business as we finished dinner. it\\'s three days later and no response. i feel the prices are a bit much and i was disappointed with the cost, amount of food, and lack of response. \\n\\nhello, \\n\\ni just wanted to reach out and express my concern for the overall meal experience, we had, tonight. \\n\\ni\\'ve had lunch before and the experience, was reasonable and the food was good. so, when my friend wanted a salad for dinner, i thought we would come back.  \\n\\nwe ordered the eggplant rollatini and i was shocked to see you only received 2 small pieces, for 9 dollars. seemed a bit underwhelming. the food was good, but the portion was lacking in size and quantity. \\n\\nwe both ordered the house salad and added on a protein. my friend added chicken and i added salmon. i was shocked when i saw my bill was $23 for salmon on top of a small house salad that costs 9.50. \\n\\ni feel that was outrageous. overall, the price was not at all in proportion to the amount of food we received. my lunch (i\\'m aware it was lunch which usually is a few dollars cheaper) was in the teens. \\n\\ni just wanted to share my opinion with you. we dine in media usually 2 times a week. thank you for your time.\\n\\nelle linden \\nsent from my iphone, when i used to live in philly and did not have a lot of money i went to this indian restaurant, its cheap and you get a lot of food. while the quantity is great, it lacks quality, there are much better indian restaurants in philly this is not one of them. you get what you pay for, there used to be 2 other buffet indian restaurants near this one., ordered from grubhub waited an hour and a half for delivery so i called naturally no one picked up for another 20 minutes then when the guy answers his explanation was that they were on break and hadn\\'t made my order yet and gave me the \" oh well\" attitude and didn\\'t offer any kind of compensation., went there for first time and had a buffet which for price is not bad considering the quantity of items served but quality wise it\\'s not good at all in my opinion. i tried everything but really didn\\'t like anything and specially i was eager to try the deserts kheer and gulab jamun and they were most terrible. i\\'m giving three starts because the manager was attentive and was doing his job very nice nicely. the restaurant is under renovation they are making it more appealing but in my opinion food quality and taste must be improved. sorry for the bitter truth but writing this review in only hope that they improve. good luck!, over the summer i ordered from here without incident. then comes fall and a particularly cold evening.\\n\\nwe placed our order or tried at first. my friend repeated the order three times.  the repeated her card number 2 times.  then became tired of repeating my address.  i gave them my address the 4th time.  we were told we\\'d get our indian goodness in 30 - 45 minutes.  not a problem.  we were fine with waiting.  we thought the repeating-ourselves-thing was pretty comical until...\\n\\nover an hour later we had no indian goodness.  we called the restaurant.  we let them know the time frame they gave us and that it was well past that time frame.  the person on the phone didn\\'t seem to understand \"we\\'ve been waiting over an hour.  can you tell us if the driver is near?\"  several times.  this time the repetition wasn\\'t comical.  then came irate guy on phone.  \"do you want your food!? do you want your food!? why do i have to tell you where the driver is!? why!?\"  my friend and i looked at each other as if to ask what just happened while irate guy on phone kept screaming \"do you want your food!?,\" etc.  \\n\\ndriver finally showed up while this phone call was taking place.  my friend collected the food and paid the tab.  \\n\\nthe food, mediocre.  before to night i was fine with waiting to get it on the latter end of the stated time.  tonight, a little late because of a lovely nor\\'easter but the person who answered the phone left such a rotten taste in my mouth that next time i will get into my wheels and haul my butt to pick up from a much better restaurant with less abusive service.\\n\\nbad service made the mediocre food... meh.\\nportions or naan and poori: fail.  yeeeeeaaahhh. no.\\nwill i order take out or delivery again from this establishment? nope.\\n\\nin short, tandoor india, you bite and not the way i like., please do not go to this place. the food is just horrible. i thought of giving this place a second chance, and i was disappointed again.\\nnot that sitar and new delhi are great, but they are much much better than tandoor.\\nplease do not torture your taste buds by going to this place., absolutely horrible. i ordered grubhub for lunch today. i ordered chicken tikka masala and garlic/cheese naan. my order arrived not even 15 minutes later, (i work about a 15 min walk away). this really worried me because they have a menu where you can order your food and they have a lunch buffet. as soon as the driver called and said he has arrived i was not too happy because i was worried and assumed that my food was just scooped from the buffet. well, i opened my food, cold. cold chicken, cold naans. pissed. being preggo and hungry and wanting a specific craving only to have it arrive cold and totally tasteless is such a let down. for 2 dinky naans and a 12oz container of food scooped from a buffet cost me $22. a freakin rip-off., not the best buffet option in the area. everything  is bland and tastes like it is reheated from frozen, samosas are especially mediocre.  go around the corner to new delhi or sitar india., staff was uncourteous and refused to provide us service because we only wanted snacks and not a full meal. if it is a policy, please mention it on your menu. walked a minute to new delhi restaurant and had the most amazing veg platter ever., so i use to go to this place back in 2005 with my family & haven\\'t been there since, so i decided to go there with some friends. bad decision! they quality of the food had went don\\'t tremendously! we waited 20 minutes for some naan and the waiter got upset when we got new food because ours was cold. the place was not sanitary and the chicken had little pieces of rocks o_o save your $$ and go to new dali instead!   \\nlast note: the tandoori chicken was raw, like still bleeding raw!!!, in our search of tasty indian food in west philly, we walked away disappointed.  the malai kofta balls were like clumpy cream of wheat. not so good.  \\n\\nit seemed to cater to the university student crowd with it\\'s overemphasis on the buffet.  give me some love, not buckets of food.  \\n\\nok, enough knocking it.  the baigan bharta was decent. but we\\'ll keep searching., so i use to go to this place back in 2005 with my family & haven\\'t been there since, so i decided to go there with some friends. bad decision! they quality of the food had went don\\'t tremendously! we waited 20 minutes for some naan and the waiter got upset when we got new food because ours was cold. the place was not sanitary and the chicken had little pieces of rocks o_o save your $$ and go to new dali instead!   \\nlast note: the tandoori chicken was raw, like still bleeding raw!!!, the minimum for delivery is $15 here, but the guy on the phone insists it\\'s $20. he just called me back and continues to insist on a $20 minimum. as a courtesy, they should\\'ve let me slide, as my order was $16.14. screw these folks! i\\'m hungry and angry., came here on a thursday night around 8 pm. when i was walking towards the restaurant i see a worker (probably the manager) looking out the door, hoping to get some customers. walking in, there were only 2 other occupied tables who were just about to be done (although to be fare, it might\\'ve been empty due to it being summer and their huge customer base left campus). the style of the resturant is nothing to rave about. the lighting was dimmed significantly. the buffet was in the middle of the restaurant, which felt kind of like a long hallway. \\n\\nmeat options are pretty standard for an indian buffet, with choices of goat curry, chicken misala, chicken curry, and tandoori chicken. none of those left me with an impression that i had to get more. on top of that, the rice was a bit hard (either they undercooked their rice or used old rice cuz they didn\\'t have a lot of customers recently).  the only side i went up to get again was the naan. lastly, the chai tea tastes really watered down. if you want a better indian buffet experience and a good chai tea at it, then i would recommend heading to sitar which is just a few streets down from tandoor., we went here on a monday night as new delhi was closed.  we would have been better off picking another cuisine instead of substituting with tandoor india.  the staff were so dour that they would have been better suited for working for a funeral home than a restaurant.  all the food was mediocre at best and the selection on the buffet was very small compared to nd.  we finished our pitcher of water and were not provided a refill.  the rice in the rice pudding was overcooked.... and i got very bloated after eating here - a reaction i have never had in the past to eating anything.  my fiance had the same outcome., do not get catering from tandoor with its new management. \\n\\nwe ordered chai tea and samosas and they brought our chai tea in a plastic gallon milk bottle (one bottle was $50, ridiculous). the tea itself is now awful too, completely bland.  we even saw traces of dried milk on the bottles, made us wonder if they even cleaned them. also those bottles have very soft plastics that nearly melted with the hot chai. previously, they brought a proper plastic container and for $50 we could serve 45+ people with no problem and it tasted great.  \\n\\nthe samosas are now also more expensive, we only got 33 with $50.  \\n\\ni haven\\'t been to the buffet since the new management, so this review is strictly for their catering practices., tandoor did not live up to expectations.  the food was bland and oily.  i highly question the palettes of people that are giving this place anything higher than 2 stars.\\n\\nmy roommate and i had take out from this place a little while ago.  we both agreed that the food was mediocre at best.  the next day, we were both sick from it.\\n\\nthey did throw in free desert, which was nice.  perhaps they do this to win over customers who otherwise would not be satisfied.\\n\\ni\\'m never going back again., this place needs a lot of attention!! the man at front desk needs to learn how to treat customers! upon my visit, i checked the buffet and while i was at door to call my other friends the front desk guy asked us to go and check the food in new delhi restaurant next door!! i was surprised as hell we often dine in there and love the food but this guy made the night , a nightmare! very disappointed and couldn\\'t understand why was he referring us to the other restaurant?!!, not authentic indian cuisine -- it tasted like the indian version of a kraft dinner.  no music, a place for lonely people to eat lunch alone, plastic chicken, and microwaved naan.  make sure you don\\'t need to use the bathroom while you are there.  it is disgusting!  redeeming qualities are decent dessert and cheap?, food was very pathetic. no taste and chicken was literally hard like rubber. non cooperative staff. seriously, if you are looking for indian food, please do not waste your money and time going here. highly disappointed. zero star., dinner buffet was a huge let-down. the restaurant was shabby looking and completely empty, which should\\'ve been a sign to turn right back around. food was clearly out all day and not flavored well. naan was hard and cold. appetizers and deserts were ok, but still not hot or delicious. definitely won\\'t be returning., don\\'t order from this place. i just got my delivery and it was close to horrible. but there are some good things that i can note. the food was ok and the packaging was great. i bought the traditional curry chicken and garlic naan (both were ok). but i ordered a masala chai and a mango lassi which was about 5 dollars, not much. when the guy came, i thought the bag was a little empty but i didn\\'t know how big the dish was, so i said nothing, and i didn\\'t look in the bag until i got to the kitchen. my order totalled 22 dollars and i have the man a 5 dollar tip. when he left and i got to my kitchen, both drinks were missing. i called the man again to ask if he had forgotten the drinks, and he said \"no the restaurant didn\\'t have them.\" if they didn\\'t have them why did he take all my money without question. i\\'m pissed. ughhhh. anyway, if you\\'re going to eat from here, go inside, it\\'s better., as indian restaurants go, this is the bottom of the list for me. i try to give every india restaurant a chance, and when i heard this place had a buffet for dinner, that clinched it. unfortunately, everything i had lacked the taste i\\'ve come to expect. the chicken makni tasted like it was made with spaghetti sauce, the shrimp masala was very fishy, and the naan bread looked and tasted like it had been on the steam table all night. for indian in philadelphia, the best so far is the indian restaurant, you\\'ll see it under my other reviews. i should have known what i was in for in terms of service when the person who showed me to my table left the pitcher of water behind. no offer for anything else, i was on my own., i was so hung over and tired on sunday, and the only thing that i wanted to eat was some indian food.  after searching yelp for a while, i decided to order from lovash, but after entering my online order plus delivery charge to where i live, food for myself was over $40.  i tried a few other places and tandoor was the only option that would deliver to my place.  (i really did not want to have to drive anywhere to pick it up, it was enough effort to get off the couch to answer the door).\\n\\nafter placing my order, one hour and $29 later i was a happy camper. \\ni do not have much indian food experience, but i thought that the food (chicken korma and saag paneer) was pretty good.  the naan could have been better, it was very rubbery from being wrapped in foil for delivery., i feel bad writing a poor review about this family-owned local restaurant... but... what i ate here was really less than average. \\nthe food was mostly dried out and tasteless. i was hungry and had to pay for the meal no matter, so i did eat it. \\nif you\\'re looking for a quality, tasty indian meal, check out the one on 38th near chilis or the one at 40th and chestnut- new delhi. \\ni will not make the same mistake twice., i often frequent tandoor\\'s sister restaurant in fishtown and it is excellent! i am sad to say that this feeling didn\\'t resonate at their establishment in university city. i encountered something that i wish to never encounter again- bland indian food. i had the chicken tikka masala- it was watery and lacking flavor. my friend had lamb saag- the highlight of her dish was the bland basmati rice. needless to say, i do not plan on returning., expensive buffet, poorly seasoned and dry meats, the only thing bumping them up one star is that their vegetables are passable. otherwise, i\\'m probably never going back here. bad indian food in my opinion, look elsewhere to get your tandoori., i\\'ve tried the buffet and on another visit tried ordering off the menu since sometimes the buffet isn\\'t the best way to judge a place. \\n\\ni don\\'t like the food here. for me, a good indian restaurant has to have good chicken makhani and there chicken makhani is not so good. i also was not very impressed by the naan or any of the other buffet items i tried (a little greasy and a little bland). \\n\\ni\\'m not going back., i guess if you were famished and had no other option this would suffice. the naan was disgusting! it was cracker like and tasted as though it was made using old oil. the korma was extremely oily, the rice was \"gummy\" and tasteless and the service was not particularly great. so incredibly disappointed, i reviewed this eatery by mistake., i ate here one monday evening because new delhi was closed and i was craving indian food.  this place isn\\'t that great.  i mean, the buffet line was almost out the door, but i highly doubt that that was reflective of the quality of the food. i ordered lamb saag, and it wasn\\'t all that great.  in fact, i boxed up my leftovers, but ended up leaving them on the table.  i knew i wouldn\\'t want to finish them.\\n\\na homeless woman came in asking for change, and once she left they sprayed air freshener in the doorway.  i\\'m assuming it was necessary, but that just rubbed me the wrong way.  i\\'m sensitive, i know.\\n\\nanywho, i won\\'t be going back.  i\\'ll just make sure that i time my cravings so they happen between tuesday and sunday.\\n\\nif you\\'re thinking about trying tir, just walk around the corner to new delhi., bad selection, and mediocre quality, as indian buffets go., under new and sleazy management.\\n\\nthe food appears to be a good deal and it does taste fairly decent, but be careful.  the waitstaff may offer you a beverage, acting as though it is on the house, but it is actually going to show up on your bill. worse: you may find yourself sick the next day with food poisoning.  \\n\\nto those with allergies: eat carefully.  although there is a sign saying that you can inquire with the staff regarding the presence of allergens, don\\'t expect the staff to actually know if there are any allergens in the the food!\\n\\nif you have a problem during your visit, don\\'t expect to receive the appropriate level of hospitality you would expect from staff in the restaurant industry.  instead, you will be treated as though you are stupid.  during our visit, the bathroom door was broken and did not lock properly.  one of the girls went to the bathroom and had the unfortunate experience of being walked in on.  when confronted with this problem, the manager insisted that this did not happen to her and did not even apologize for the embarrassing event. \\n\\nthe meager difference in price between tandoor\\'s buffet and sitar\\'s buffet does not warrant my return visit to tandoor., they put tags over old tags on the meat! the tag on the bottom had an expiration date of 8 days prior. now i know why they have signs on the door saying no returns without a receipt. the smell of this place should turn you away at the door!, pass...pass...pass. i will never come back to this place. lets start of with the staff. the two guys behind the poultry counter have no type of customer service experience. \"what you need?\". that is one heck of a greeting. how could i ever forget the one texting while we were waiting for service. the chicken went bad within a a few days. i mean it smelled like it had sat out for over a week. the chicken breast was extremely fatty. the turkey wings had feathers still on them and were not probably stored away. the ends of the wings were freezer burned. i was told by a local to never get the deli meat because its slimey and does not last long. the shop is horrible looking. looks like a a setting from bates motel. the staff was far from friendly. i won\\'t even bring up the \"welcoming committee\" that was waiting for you when you pulled up. i almost did not get out the car. save yourself the trip and the fuss...move on., i got a case of chicken wings and lunch meat from this store and they both sucked. the chicken was bruised and had a ton of feathers. the lunch meat was smelly n sticky. don\\'t go here. you really do get what you pay for, once upon a time there was a concept called customer service. video library embodied that concept by having a catalog of the movies so you could browse more than just top hits and recent favorites and by having a staff of more than two employees. recently all that has changed.  now both their bored staff members are nothing but rudeness and attitude.  they have boxes on display but when asked those films are usually \"damaged with no intent to replace\" or \"not available right now\" and heavens forbid you ask for a similar recommendation you are simply told \"no.\"   most recently i managed to get four movies (it took two trips as the computers were down so i could only pay for two up front) and unsurprisingly only two of those movies worked.  when informed about the first brokenly damaged dvd, i got an eye roll and the bill for the other two movies.  i return the other damaged movie tomorrow (it\\'s actually a tv series).  i am certain i will get nothing but sympathy then too.  and no, i was not offered any sort of refund or credit on my account.  paying for a service i didn\\'t receive-the new face (or farce) of customer service)\\n\\ni wish i could say go elsewhere, but sadly in this neighborhood there is no where else to go., this place no longer exists. in its place is a used book store/coffee shop called read and eat which is pretty cool., i understand that covid has taken its toll on places such as cafe with soul.  being a not-for-profit must make it especially hard.  \\nmy last visit however was inexcusable under any circumstances.  \\nonce cws was my go-to in doylestown/cross keys.  the food last visit was inedible, (and i ordered the special) the service was sub par and indifferent.  if they hope to survive post-covid they need to step up their game., i was so happy when they opened a long time fan of the bread crumb. i was happy to see the menu items were still consistent, and quality of food was excellent. unfortunately in the 3 times i have been there service was subpar. all3 times i practically had to beg for service. i never got a refills in my drink even though i asked, had to ask for my check all 3 times i had to ask for my check. today was my last time here, never coming back.  there were 5 people working only one was being a waitress, on busing tables, the others were there doing nothing. i gave them a chance hoping that they were finding there rhythm. sadly i don\\'t think they ever will. my joy of them opening has been replaced with disappointment.  today i didn\\'t even get what i ordered but couldn\\'t say anything about it because no one stopped by to see how things were., this place flat out sucks. i walk in, nobody was there to greet us or take our seat so we were waiting for 10 minutes to be seated. the booths were super small and uncomfortable. the service was beyond awful. very understaffed. took 10 minutes to get menus and another 10 minutes to order our drinks. my coffee mug was salty and coffee was watery. i could\\'ve made better chocolate milk at my house. the food was the worst part. my moms pancakes were to the point where she couldn\\'t even eat them. my chicken and waffles were also inedible. chicken was overcooked and rubbery. waffles were doughy. we ask to take it back and the waitress gives us attitude and argues with us. definitely never trying this dump of a  breakfast place again., i so wanted to like this restaurant.  love their mission, i like the work they did for covid safety. but i really can\\'t find much positive to say about our visit. took about 45 minutes to get our egg breakfast for 2.  i wasn\\'t timing it - but people came in, ordered, ate, paid and left while we waited. when finally served my husband - who ordered eggs, home fries, sausage and french toast was served eggs, hash browns and bacon. the french toast arrived about 10 minutes later. i ordered a side of bacon, which i didn\\'t receive - but i tried my husbands bacon and it was inedible. obviously microwaved and so tough you couldn\\'t even bite it. a breakfast establishment should be able to deliver good bacon and home fries. my home fries were blackened and hard. didn\\'t even bother mentioning any of this - no one seemed to care. waitress never asked if everything was okay.  while we waited for our food to arrive we finished our drinks and weren\\'t offered refills until our food showed up. won\\'t be back., drove 1/2 hour only to be told at 2:00 that they already shut off the grill and that they close at 2:30. not very accommodating. will not be back., terrible place. food was mediocre. everyone was so disrespectful and loud. the staff was disorganized and getting service seemed like a ridiculous thing to ask for there. the manager/head of staff yelled at one of her staff right in front of me for something that wasn\\'t his fault. it was so disruptive to hear during my breakfast and completely inappropriate. when i tried standing up for the boy, she corrected me instead of understanding how inappropriate what she did was. all staff is loud and disorganized, it was a very un-relaxing breakfast. wish i could rate this a negative number.  never coming back. miss my old breadcrumbs :(, was told 35 min for a pickup order show up 35-40 mins later and still waited another 45mins for a mediocre pizza and soggy fries, we ate in the restaurant and the food was great even though they gave us plastic utensils we order delivery tonight at 7:15 pm it is now 904 and we\\'re still waiting for our food they told us it would be one hour and we\\'re getting close to 2 hours now did delivery is absolutely horrendous.  if you want to good pizza eat in the restaurant do not do not do not order delivery, this review is only for gluten-free diners. i am celiac, and i went with my husband to this restaurant because he had been hoping to give it a shot. i was happy to see they offered a gluten free pizza. i ordered, and told the server that i had celiac disease, and asked if the pizza would be safe. i was assured they would take extra precautions. when the pizza arrived, i used my nima tester and confirmed that gluten was present in the pizza. \\n\\ni certainly understand if a busy restaurant cannot accommodate those of us with celiac disease. however, if you advertise gluten free and state it is safe, that is wrong. this restaurant is not safe for celiacs.\\n\\nas for the regular pizza, my husband did not like his pizza and we had to stop someplace else to pick up dinner. the crust was oily, the toppings were uncooked, and the cheese was not melted. perhaps it was an off night all around, but at this time, we would not recognize this as a good place to go in king of prussia, i understand being 20 min behind schedule for a delivery, but we are going on 2 hours!! i ordered my food at 9.00p and it said i would get it by 9.45p, it\\'s now 11.30p and still no food! \\n\\ni don\\'t get it. the restaurant is less than 10 min from my house. no order should take this long. \\n\\nif you want italian: do not go here. you\\'re order will never arrive!!, mediocre pizza. the crust was overly thin and the pizza was bland. thin layer of cheese was orange from the grease. ordered mozzarella fries and they were burnt with barely any cheese on them. can\\'t say i\\'ll go back. the food looked nothing like others\\' pictures., the pizza was very greasy. ordered meat lovers and was very unhappy. if your looking to order pizza from this place. i wil hard pass on this one., we have been to salvatore\\'s 3x now and will not likely be back.  this last time, we mistakenly ordered the \"chicago deep dish\" please rename this ridiculously doughy pan pizza.  the concept of deep dish is to use the depth of the pan to fill with delicious sauce, cheese, and meats.  this was thick sicilian dough crammed into a pan and just topped like a normal pizza.  please google deep dish or rename this misleading terrible product!!!!, i got the veal parmigiana the other night.  flavor was excellent however veal was like rubber.  veal should be very tender but this was terrible. could not even eat it.  not sure if she t was just overcooked or bad quality veal.  but would have given 5 stars if it was tender.  spaghetti tasted amazing., ordered personal brooklin style and chicken sand which  extra tomatoes and onion. with honey mustard on side. after being notified they didn\\'t have the dough for my personal size pizza.said they could make a med. scratching my head i said that\\'s fine. at checkout. was up chargered for the medium  pizza that took twice the dough. (why i scratched my head when i ordered.) pizza twice the price of the  personal  i wanted   got home to find chicken sand which smothered in cheese and honey mustard  and onions. no tomatoes   fyi. brookline style pizza is made upside down. meaning sauce on top not here. spent 28$. and went right in the trash, we wanted to give a local establishment a try to support them but will not be returning. while the food was passable, there are many better restaurants in the area serving similar food and better. the real clincher was that we ordered a pizza which they forgot to send us home with along with our order. we had already gotten home but had to turn around to go back. i asked for an extra mini cannoli that comes with entrees for our time and trouble. when we arrived, the owner said they couldn\\'t do that and blames the mistake on an employee that was new. we had a sizeable order, but they have lost out me business over poor customer service and a $1 cannoli., forgot ranch for the wings. wings were soggy. would not order again. took over an hour for delivery., i was so excited to try this place but it was such a big disappointment.    the pizza wasn\\'t good at all.  chicken parmigiana was a joke.   the wings were breaded so you just got a lot of breading.  felt like saying where the meat.   the cheese fries i would say was the best thing out of the whole order., if this is the chicken spot by rite aid do not go there. twice i\\'ve gone back and they sold me uncooked chicken. very dissatisfied with this place. waste of money, the pizza is subpar at best. the owner was a douche bag to my brother. we asked for a box and an employee told us his boxes are trash and pizza is quality. lol what?! well let me tell you. size doesn\\'t matter. his pizza is trash. like his 50 cent boxes. fight the urge and go elsewhere!\\nwith love,\\nthe ducci duo!, biggest piece of tasteless pizza. how do they do it?  crust -- tasteless. cheese -- tasteless. sauce -- tasteless. what a waste of calories!   once is plenty for me. not going back. so many other choices here in the borough.  much improvement needed for a $3.50 slice of plain., bigger in this case is not better. but they are open late. if you are a west chester student and it\\'s 2:00 am the bar has thrown you out and you got your dink on. then by all means!, i was very anxious to try their pizza as i had been to the south street location. i drove around the block twice to get a spot to park. as i approached several people were eating inside. the doors were locked!\\nit was 9:50.. you are not going to win over new customers closing early . disappointing, i didn\\'t even get to the food when i was giving the most sarcastic attitude by the \"manager\" a.k.a the owners daughter.  i asked if they had a minimum for credit,  most places do.  $5 no biggie.  a slice was $3.50, i asked if i don\\'t meet the minimum could they just charge an extra .50 for the credit fee they accrue. this chick come from behind and scolds the cashier after just saying it can be done to both her and i and looks at me and says \"no, it\\'s 1.50\" basically saying that it\\'s a $5 minimum no matter what. i asked if there was a manager and she said it was her. i mentioned that every other locations that i\\'ve been to has always charged additional 50 to $0.75 charge for the credit charge. her attitude continued to the point where i called her out for it, i said the business owner should have taught her about when people don\\'t meet minimums. at which point she continued with her attitude telling me that she was the owner\\'s daughter. needless to say me and my young child left and will not be back. i\\'ve never met a business so unwilling to charge an additional amount because a minimum amount is not met. you would think that they would have taken the money even if it wasn\\'t the minimum. from what i hear i\\'m not missing out anyway, apparently benny\\'s is better., i was expecting more from this hyped up pizza joint. very bland pizza. the large slice is more a gimmick and not practical. back to rigtown for me., i\\'ve never had the food from here before. but i must say the manager is the absolute worse. lol. i literally just got off the phone with him, where he told me to \"never call here again.\" i guess me trying to get a refund for my order just was too much for him to handle. the manager has some issues he needs to work on. i asked for his name, he said \"you don\\'t need to know my name, call me boss\" \\n\\ni won\\'t even go further into it. just know if you ever have the chance to encounter an experience with the manager here, expect hell. he\\'s terrible. told me to call him boss........ like come on man what man says that to another man. \\n\\nso here\\'s to boss, continue running your great successful lorenzos & sons. one day i aspire to leave my well paying career and manage a lorenzo\\'s and sons pizza. one day! \\n\\nboss, one last thing, i will be calling back., i like that lorenzo\\'s pizza is open late and it is cheap. i think their sauce is very bland tasting and very sweet. i don\\'t like my pizza like that at all. i had a very negative encounter with the security guard who wouldn\\'t let me in because i wanted to use the bathroom as my boyfriend stood in line. he followed me throughout the restaurant and made me leave without letting me use the restroom. he then refused to tell me his name. i find that to be extremely poor customer service. i left without giving my services to lorenzo\\'s and do not intend to be back. i wish to see a change in employees., customer service is horrible, was spoken to in a very rude manor using the word \"fuck,\" good pizza but awful staff, nothing about this place made sense. i tried to get a pizza and they made me wait longer than anyone who\\'s got their after me. fuck their bartender, oh geez. this place is pretty \\'meh\\'. i like how slices are $3.50 and their debit/credit limit is 5 bucks; but oh wait, toppings are only $1, each!  the crust is hard, burnt and charred on the bottom and overall the pizza is just big, pretty bland tasting overall. i like the interior, they really put a lot of money into it and the staff is nice. it\\'s a shame that such a nice location and interior is used to target drunk college kids on thursday/friday/saturday nights. i\\'ve walked past here several times in the evening and have seen lots of stumbling/bumbling people outside and quite a lot of yelling/boarder line fighting going on inside. this is a place that you go to once and move on. would recommend benny\\'s/chris\\'s/rigtown/brother\\'s., just doesn\\'t taste great. too salty and tasteless. too bad. was hoping it would be better., you know how some pizza boxes have the slogan, \"you\\'ve tried all the rest, now try the best?\" lorenzo\\'s should have the slogan, \"you\\'ve tried all the rest, now try the worst\". oh wait, you\\'d only get to read that slogan if you pay extra, because, yes, they charge you for the box if you want to take it out!! the pizza is basically flavorless aside from the super sweet sauce. they are surviving on their gimmick large slices, and drunk college students who would eat a piece of cardboard but opt for pizza, because here you need to pay for both., they rely on big slices and a prime location for business. if you\\'re serious about getting decent food in west chester, don\\'t waste your time here. \\n\\ncheese is bland. crust is bland. the cheese slice wasn\\'t very good. i\\'ve been here twice now and was disappointed both times. the taste is patently mediocre, even as drunk food. their offerings taste mass produced, which they are., don\\'t count on being able to get a slice or two if it\\'s less than 30 minutes before closing time. they actually locked the place up still full of customers! eventually came to the door and demanded a 4 slice minimum to \"make another pizza.\"  god forbid a place this busy would have to send the employees home with a partial pizza at the end of the night!  why don\\'t you serve your customers up until your posted closing time?, staff needs to watch their language when customers are in the restaurant waiting for food- especially when they have children!, in west chester, there\\'s a high volume of pizza places (most likely to cater to the high school crowd and office crowd during the weekdays). lorenzo\\'s is located in probably the best spot in-town for anyone to travel to, however they don\\'t really live up to the expectation. \\n\\nthe pizza we got tonight was very dough-y, as if not baked the whole way through. to put it into perspective, our jaws ached by our second or third slice of the 28\" pie (i was hungry!). the cheese and sauce were probably the best i\\'ve had in west chester, but then again the dough really did ruin the experience of the pizza. \\n\\none big thing was about asking if we could have separate toppings on only half the pizza, and when the ma\\'am who answered the phone said yes, we assumed we would get a decent amount of both topping. only one topping covered half the pie well - the other half was about 80% cheese and 20% topping, and what topping there was wasn\\'t spread out, but instead in clumps., i have mixed feelings about this place, unfortunately.  for instance, i just went in to order a slice, and the two young women who were working behind the counter were pretty rude.  one of them literally slapped my slice of pizza on the counter in front of me, without heating it up in the oven (it was cold).  and it\\'s not like they were busy - it was sunday evening, and i was the only one in line., i am convinced their popularity must be based on location/novelty of the ridiculous size of the slices/price.  my group all found the pizza to edible but completely lacking in flavor and would not bother coming back again., this was our favorite pizza spot in west chester by far. we tried getting it delivered and we were told they don\\'t deliver to where we live (even though we have had delivery from them dozens of times before). in fact, the owner himself had told us they would deliver to us a little over 2 years ago when we had stopped in the store to grab a slice. the last few times we have gotten delivery from them they have been nasty about delivering to us as if it is an inconvenience to them, even though the owner himself had made the promise to us. when i told the woman on the phone about this, i could hear the owner in the background yelling and cursing about me asking why this an issue all of a sudden. i finally asked to speak to owner so i could better understand why his promise had suddenly changed. when he got on the phone he kept cutting me off telling me \"we are busy right now,\" we don\\'t have time for this.\" once i was finally able to try and tell him he made the promise to us, he said \"who are you? i don\\'t even know who you are?\" when i tried telling him the story he continued to cut me off and raise his voice. i finally asked him \"do you want me to tell you they story or no?\" and he replied nastily saying \"no not really.\" \\ni will not be giving them our business again...a business owner who has no issue with disrespecting repeat customers and can\\'t seem to stick to his word will not be one i support.\\n\\nwe are being asked to support our local businesses in west chester, and we were happy to do that, but this restaurant has poor customer service, and we will gladly choose another to support., hi so i wanted to enter my card and they didn\\'t believe me i owned it they were being so odd i have been a customer several times they definitely were rude and not assumed, honestly, i was not at all impressed with the girls behind the counter. they were unfriendly and came off pretty rude. their hours are also really tough. there have been multiple occasions where we\\'ve said \"let\\'s get lorenzo\\'s\" but they were already closed. big bummer. however their pizza slices are massive and pretty dang good., not in love with this place.  it\\'s pretty clearly geared towards an old folks clientele (there are notes all over the menu about extra charges for sharing), though we were able to walk in on saturday night at 8 with no reservation and be seated almost right away despite a pretty full house, so that\\'s always nice.  service was quite good, my water glass was never empty, but the food was mediocre.\\n\\ni had the mirna\\'s soup, which is shrimp, potatoes, spinach and basil all in a kind of strange broth that was neither good nor bad.  one of my shrimp hadn\\'t been cleaned/de-veined well, but other than that it was a decent soup.  the bread was fine, the pita was extremely dry.  i also had a seafood caesar salad, which wasn\\'t very good.  the crab was a little fishy and the dressing was a little strange, not caesar-y more like an olive oil dressing.  also there was one olive in the salad, i guess as like a little bonus.  odd.\\n\\nalso tried the fried calamari (chewy but good marinara sauce) and my husband\\'s penne vodka, which i thought was perfectly good.  i guess the trick is to get the pasta here.  we had desserts that were fine but nothing i would order again.  neither the apple cake or the cheesecake tasted very fresh.\\n\\noverall, the price was pretty high for the quality of the food, and while the general restaurant scene in jenkintown is pretty abysmal, i think you can do better than this place.  not planning to return., classic overbooker, you fooled me once so shame on me. won\\'t be back. if you want to leave me standing for 45 minutes past my reservation time in a rush-hour-subway-crowded freezing anteroom with a drafty door that opens right up onto the street, please make sure that you\\'re about to thrill me with the best food i\\'ve ever tasted in my life and not the merely ok fare that i was eventually served. at least have the decency to pass out complimentary drinks or hors d\\'oeuvres to the dutifully (stupidly?) waiting hordes of shivering 50- and 60-somethings who, after a quarter of an hour or so of being cooped up together may have begun to believe that they were being watched by hidden cameras as part of some penn phd candidate\\'s psychology project.\\n\\ni can live with rejection, but not with being lied to. if you don\\'t have the seats, don\\'t take the reservation. it\\'s that simple., worst restaurant i have ever eaten at. wife & i suffered from old poisoning.\\nservice was poor & mixed up our orders.\\n20minutes to get the new check\\nabsolutely horrible., went to go get some dinner, saw one of your cooks outside in his obviously very food covered apron smoking.  how disgusting. your cooks that stand out front speak for your establishment and that is not \"healthy\" or ckean. i will not be back, there was hair in our sandwich! yuck!!! not going back there !!!!\\n\\nit is very sad to see this place going down.... it used to be a nice local place to go , but over the past few years since they got new manager/ (owner?) it\\'s only getting worse and worse...., mirna\\'s folded up after labor day. they had 1 waiter for 7 years who worked the entire place on weeknight\\'s with a help wanted sign in the window for years. i\\'d eat there with my wife on either a wednesday at 7pm or a sunday around 6pm, and if there were three tables dining during those evening hours it was a surprise. i never was in there when it was busy\\n\\nmore than 1/2 of jenkintown has folded up in addition to mirna\\'s, where businesses that have been there for years are now replaced by either asian nail salons, kick boxing gyms and aerobic class rented spaces. so sterile and revolting with no character and no charm whatsoever. the borough has no identity and is looking worse along rt 611 as each month passes. the dining scene is sparse and the service abysmal conmprised of amateur servers from place to place and hefty prices. an asian luncheonette on west avenue closed after just 6 months;(jake\\'s ). service was an atrocity and the owner was a homophobe. the tiny french place across the street is now southern cuisine with strange hours, a broom closet sized restaurant. who know\\'s what will go in there next. marzano\\'s is just fair ( still no liquor license ).  there is virtually no place ( decent ) to dine now on a stretch from the corner of west avenue & 611 all the way up to vintage tavern in abington, unless you consider bella\\'s good italian. and they are closed on sunday, the one day italians like getting family together for dinner.  once again, the town needs an identity as millennials have moved in to change the landscape with a brewery next to the hiway theater. and we all saw what happened to that previous owner. they closed up shop in the blink of an eye. i remember the bartender texting on his phone for 4 min after i sat down, totally oblivious to people who had just come in. not exaggerating..the service in the county sucks big time., this past friday evening i dined with my girlfriend at mirna\\'s cafe on old york road in jenkintown.  i have not visited mirna\\'s in easily a decade as i have moved out of the area and was back visiting family.\\nmirna\\'s has changed and for the worse. \\nwe sat down at about 9:30pm and the food looked and tasted like it had been prepared some time around 4pm.  for an appetizer we ordered the muscles, which were way overdone and appeared to have been simmering for about the past decade.   i ordered the mirna\\'s shrimp, and i could not get past the first bite.  my girlfriend ordered some pasta with shrimp, which while edible, was not enjoyable.\\nthe staff of mirna\\'s was the only plus.  they were kind and attentive, and i saw them sprint out the door and run all up and down old york road in order to return a wallet to a patron who had forgotten it.\\ni hope that mirna\\'s takes better care of its earlier seating than it did us late-comers.  i was unimpressed and will not return--ever.  huge disappointment., my husband and i scheduled my daughter\\'s first child baby shower at mirna\\'s.  we agreed  on prices, went over the menu and agreed with a handshake.  i thought it strange that when we tried several times to meet with the owners to finalize details, we couldn\\'t get in touch with them. we went in two weeks before the shower before the restaurant opened and i left in tears. the owner changed the price and wouldn\\'t budge and pretty much told us there was nothing we could do about it because we wouldn\\'t find another place in two weeks.  i was in tears. i couldn\\'t even imagine celebrating such a special event at this place. i went home, got on the internet and luckily mike\\'s bar and grill in warminster had a cancellation for the date of the shower.  i forfeited our deposit with mirna\\'s.  mike\\'s did a beautiful job and went out of there way to make sure everything went well.  i would highly recommend it for any event you need.  we will never go back to mirna\\'s and neither will my friends.  i had to contact everyone to change the plans.  they were appalled.  there are too many other customer friendly put you first restaurants out there.  they are scam artists.  get everything in writing if you plan to hold an event at this place and check your receipts.  they overcharge on the bill too if they can get away with it., cute little eatery. the staff was nice. we ordered the rosemary hand cut steak sandwich. eating half took quite a while as the chunks of steak were so dry and tough. it was hard to get through eating this. if we stop in again would order the pizza as all of the pizzas looked good., looking forward to a traditional new england lobster roll. this is not the place to go. while the lobster meat was excellent, it was served on a torpedo style untoasted roll. the biggest grievous sin was serving the lobster on a bed of kale. there is no decor to this place. while ordering, the chef/owner was sticking his index finger in his mouth. failed to wash hands before handling food. first and last visit to this place, are you kidding me !! ordered the warm lobster roll with mango and jalapeño peppers and a traditional roll . the lobster was fishy and tasted like it was just defrosted . the roll was so overwhelming that it almost didn\\'t matter how bad the lobster was !! to make it worse was the 16.95 price each ... what a rip..was going to go back to get reimbursed but i was so upset i threw the sandwich in the garbage so i couldn\\'t prove it to as inedible!, my family of 6 came to peddlers village tonight, a few days before christmas. it was very crowded and all of the sit-down restaurants had hour+ wait times, so we stopped in here. i ordered the shrimp po boy which was inedible- completely soaked in grease and the shrimp were fried with the shells on! not to mention it was $12.99 and mostly bread. we each ordered fries and polished them off before we got the rest of the food. the staff was eating behind the counter while serving food. i could go on but please save your money., expect lobster roll around here to be made with frozen lobster meat, which can be ok if defrosted properly. unfortunately the meat was water logged, texture not good. there was no seasoning, just blah. really disappointing., i ordered fish tacos and received 2 small (tiny)tacos and cost me  $10.99.  i was still hungry afterwards. not worth the money spent. please take note., went there for a valentine day lunch.  the place was very dirty; floors, tables and especially 1 bathroom.  the food was just ok... the roll used in the lobster roll was way too big... like it should have been used for a meatball sandwich not lobster.  plus it had some sort of greens in it like broccoli rabe  or spinach which we have never experienced before.  we were really hoping we would like it but we didn\\'t.  sad about that because peddlers village needs some better food spots., we we\\'re pretty hungry at peddler\\'s village after shopping for many hours so we stopped by to look at the menu. it seemed pretty good - wide variety of pizza which we originally were going to order , some sandwiches and cheesesteaks  as well as lobster rolls. when i came inside half of the menu was crossed over- it was understanding because maybe they were going through some new renovations. as i approached the cashier i was going to get one of their michele pizza. however i was told that they only had 3 types which didn\\'t seem too appealing to me. i was a bit disappointed because i was anticipating a wide variety of pizza just like the advertised menu said. their stove had been replaced that day and they didn\\'t have their original pizzas. brushing all feelings aside i asked what was the best thing on the menu. she gave us basically everything that wasn\\'t scratched over which didn\\'t really help. so i just got the truffle fries and the cheese steak. the wait took a while .... when we got our food the truffle fries tasted as if they had been cooked on really old oil or it just had a strange taste to it. the cheesteakmaybe had like 10 small pieces of meat on it and it was sooooooo dry. for the price that i paid it wasn\\'t worth it. honestly i probably wouldn\\'t come back here the food wasn\\'t great, and  the menu was very limited. i think even without it being scratched out it\\'s still limited and the quality isn\\'t that great. i understand the difficulties of the pizza stove which is why i gave it one more star but i would have given it 1 star. take your money somewhere else, we ordered food for delivery tonight and everything was wrong in our order... when we got our delivery and called back they were very rude and told us that we were racist.... i will never order from there ever again!!!!!!!!!! wow!!!! you can\\'t just have some customer service and replace our order???? i will only order from pearl garden in east norriton!!!!!, typical americanized gloppy chinese food you expect from these take out only joints. general tso\\'s chicken was mediocre, dumplings doughy. i\\'ve had worse chinese food but there was nothing memorable about this food to make me want to order it again (i.e. reminded me of china house and china king in kop, meh)., i hope you enjoy having stink bugs in your soup, because this is what you\\'ll get in this sorry establishment. i brought back the wonton soup with the stink bug in it, and they tried to convince me it was an onion. last time i checked, onions don\\'t have legs. disgusting!!!! the employees should be disgusted with their nasty selves! the food is low quality and don\\'t be surprised when you find creepy crawlers mixed in your food. a friend of mine told me she found a fly in her meal she got here. i am so disgusted and cannot believe this place has not been shut down yet please never go here., where do i even start? this place is absolutely rancid. found bugs in my food not once, but twice!! at first, i gave them the benefit of the doubt, thinking that the bug could have gotten on my food in my house, but the second time, i found a stink bug in my wonton soup! that was enough for me! i brought the soup containing the bug back to the restaurant to show them, and the worker argued with me for 10 minutes that it was an onion. this was a very large stink bug with legs!!!\\n\\nplease don\\'t go here, unless you enjoy bugs in your food. :), we tried this for the first time based upon posts in a local facebook group.  food tasted like it was reheated from lunch.  bland.  husband was sick all night.  we will not be back., ordered for the first time there last night . was expecting a seafood dinner- i asked specifically if the crab meat was real crab or imitation. i was told real, \" we don\\'t use imitation.\" well my dog is getting tonight for his dinner- horrible and a waste of money!, im still puzzled as to why we were treated so poorly here. my boyfriend and i drove 30 min to dine here because we heard that the food was authentic and delicious - and it was. the service however was the worst that i have ever experienced. i speak some spanish but when the waitress first approached us i couldn\\'t make out everything she was saying, so i apologized and said i didn\\'t speak it. this seemed to really upset her, she turned around and didn\\'t come back for awhile. when she returned she seemed angry at us and even angrily corrected our pronunciations as we ordered. the rest of the time we watched her stop multiple times at all the tables around us, avoiding our empty glasses and not once checking in. we brushed this off because we understand how the language barrier can be difficult. we eventually signaled for the check and this last part still disturbs me. my boyfriend hands his debit card and when she returned, she hands it to me (not to my bf) shows me a debit card receipt for $.50 and loudly tells me repeatedly that he has no money. my bf asks if the card was declined because the receipt doesn\\'t show anything besides the $.50 charge.... if it was declined it would just be declined...period ... she doesn\\'t answer him, but faces more at the crowd, says something loudly and i see other tables turning around to look at us with that \"how embarrassing for you\" look... i don\\'t know what was said but it was very clear that we were not welcomed at this restaurant. we left a $10 tip on less than $30 meal so hopefully they will treat another couple like us a little better next time. we will not be returning., una por que no le puedo dar menos. \\nhorrible el servicio\\nsalio una cucaracha de la sopa de mi hija. y todavia insinuan qe nosotros la pusimos ahi. despues de esperar casi una hora para comer. como para echarle una cucaracha a la comoda solo por qe si. \\nel arroz con leche ahumado y me dice todavia la señora. \"se pego pero poqitito\" horrible. \\nhorrible, the food is very good but the ability to turnover the tables is a huge problem on busy days. waited over an hour to be seated today and about an hour to get food. i just do not have 2 hours available to get breakfast. they do not have the proper staffing to quickly get the food out and clear tables in a timely fashion. there were many upset people there due to the time to wait. while we were eating there were 2 empty tables for at least 15 minutes that they did not seat anyone at yet when we left there was a longer line than when i arrived which we waited an hour to be seated. the workers were trying but were simply overwhelmed. management needs to do a better job handling the staffing schedules. i will not be coming back due to this experience., this place is just horrible,,,,, i have tried this place twice and i will never go back.\\nthe poatatoes might be the worst ive had borderline unedible,,, and the wait is suprising because of how bad the food is , they all must be there for the first time, i cant understand how they get any returning business. i have been in the food industry for over 20 years , i live in glenside and would love to have this my go to place but it is just too poor a product.. as soon as you order they drop your toast ,,, why?   when your food finally does come out your toast is cold ,,, just failing grades acrosss the board, i can well agrees with erica and teri, the village as they call it, has to be the dirtiest diner around. someone needs to tell the owners, who are there almost everyday, what a paint brush and a mop and bucket are. don\\'t even try the rest rooms, they have not been scrubbed in years, the same hot water faucet in the one bathroom has been broken for years, spewing scalding hot water on you hands if you try to clean them. and employes wash their hands here?!... yeah, right. why the locals eat there i don\\'t know, their bodies must have built up an immunity. my wife and i went there when it was new many years ago, it was your basic diner. we tried recently and actually cut our meal short due to the condition of our silverware. now to the food, yes they drop your toast when your order is put in and then it just sits in a pile for each server to grope over. they always burn the omlettes. the potatoes are undercooked and very greasy. overall i can say the food is bland and lacks any real flavor. i have not had any other meal than breakfast . but please would someone buy this place, blow it up and clean it out. it needs it top to bottom. enjoy your meal at the village diner, if you dare..., i recently visited this diner due to a segment on the local  news in the winter. while the service was ok, the food was less than pleasing. it was tasteless and not appetizing at all. the bacon and turkey sausage were like plastic and cardboard- could have went to a fast food joint for that! the only thing worth ordering was the rye toast. even the cranberry juice was not a good brand of juice. needless to say i will not be returning. i will visit michael\\'s if i need a diner or fairlane grill in flourtown. i only gave 2 stars because the service was not bad., unfortunetly i had to go back for a third visit ,, i could not get out of it,, anyway , i did go with an open mind hoping things had changed,,,, i was not disapointed, the only reason i gave 1 star is because i couldnt give none, this may be the worst diner that i have ever gone to, ever !!!!  i thought i would try something easy that they could not mess up, i now think that is impossible they even serve cold toasted bagels ,,, the only thing that was more shocking than the food was how dirty it was. if you want to get your day off to a bad start then by all means go here !!!!!, my boyfriend and i are staying at a friends house right next to the keswick theatre and she told us this place had good breakfast sandwiches to go, so we decided to try them but changed our mind when we talked in and decided to sit and eat. \\n\\nwe sat ourselves at the bar and started off on the wrong foot after the two waitresses didn\\'t greet us right away, they were too busy chatting it up with some of the spots usual patrons. one of the servers, still ignoring us, went to the back to get a yogurt and ate it right there behind the counter while she continued to talk to the other customers. she got halfway through her snack before the other server made a motion towards us and then she came over and said hello. so the fact that we had to watch her eat with her back turned at us before we were even greeted or got coffee irritated me a lot. \\n\\nfrom that point on it the service did improve slightly. the food itself wasn\\'t good. i ordered the \"village scrambler\" which was supposed to have onion and peppers in it, but i maybe tasted them in 2 bites total. the pieces were tiny and very sparse, which is a shame because i ordered that number intentionally because it had veggies in it. the \"home fries\" were not what i know home fries as. they were thinly sliced potato circles that had been dropped in a deep fryer. they tasted stale, as if they had been dropped, cooled down, then re-dropped for my order. maybe that\\'s standard for some diners to serve home fries that way, but i prefer mine fries on a griddle so they are a little crispy on the outside. \\n\\nservice was slow leaving the diner as well. we sat there with our plates and mugs empty and tried to make eye contact with the servers, but once again they were deep in small talk with some customers on the other side of the bar. \\n\\ni am sad this place was disappointing because it looks so cute and welcoming. i might try it again but i\\'ll stick to the breakfast sandwiches to go., i won\\'t ever go back. i\\'ll tell you why.\\n\\nfirst of all, the place is so small, my family had to wait for 45 minutes or more with only one other family in line after us for a late sunday breakfast. this was even more frustrating on top of being insanely hungry because we watched how slow the minimal staff was getting food out. \\n\\nsecondly, as i looked around during my wait, i couldn\\'t help notice how dirty the place looked. i\\'m talking unswept, unmopped, trash overflowingly full in the bathroom...and again...it\\'s a tiny place. really, there isn\\'t anyone who can clean up the place? if there hadn\\'t been any soap in the restroom i probably would have left.\\n\\nthe food coming out at least looked decent, so we decided to stay and try it anyway.\\n\\nonce we were at a table, i frowned at my coffee cup. there was a blatant coffee ring around the inside, clearly not properly washed or looked into. hey, my dishwasher sucks too, but at least i pick up a sponge every now and then. i requested another.\\n\\nthe kids had grilled cheese sandwiches, i had the cream chipped beef. i found the gravy to be more like soup....yech...it tasted alright after some salt & pepper, but i\\'ll stick with mayfair diner for that dish in the future. my husband had an omelette, but they made the wrong kind. usually he would just eat it, but he really didn\\'t want bell peppers that morning so he had to send it back. \\n\\nif you do decide to go (my cousin liked it and sent me there in the first place, so it does suit some folks) all i can say is just don\\'t get the creamy chipped beef (soup on a plate)., disgusting breakfast. the one thing i expect a diner to be good at is breakfast. the quality was poor. cheap ingredients. generic brands. i was even disappointed that they only offered generic sweet and  low no splenda for coffee. i asked for over easy eggs and got runny eggs. toast was tough and cheap bread. the pumpkin pancakes were over beaten making the texture very chewy. the bacon was burnt and felt like i was eating ashes. coffee was weak, the syrup was fake nasty stuff. my home fries were not home fries they were potatoe chips. over priced. the waitress was nice that was the only nice thing. should\\'ve went to dunkin donuts but i thought this place looked cute. the food surely is not cute. it reminded me of when i made breakfast in the 3rd grade., we didn\\'t actually get to eat here, but we tried. when we walked in there were 2 customers ahead of us. they said it would be a 10 minute wait, after 30 minutes they sat us at a table that was only appropriate for a my size barbie doll to sit at. after waiting another 10 minutes no one took our drink orders or even acknowledged us. multiple customers were complaining about the wait time for their food. we ended up just walking out, if you have all day to wait then this is the place for you., don\\'t go - unless you want to wait and have  people  who know the staff cut in front of you for a table. we called them out and said \"excuse me, we\\'ve been waiting for 15 mins\" and they shrugged. we left the place and told them we\\'ll take our business elsewhere., frozen means \"fresh\" at the village diner.  my belgian waffle with \"seasonal fresh fruit\" was served with frozen blueberries nuked in a microwave.  the waffle itself was as tasty as soggy cardboard.  who wants to pay for low quality food when you can make a much better meal at home?  not me., i want to love this place. \\ni\\'ve taken my 8 yo nephew and 6 yo niece twice recently, and both times they were so close to making me like them, but i refuse to go back a third time.\\nit\\'s really small. like, something gets knocked off the table every time. like, you wind up conversing with the table next to you because you can\\'t help but to hear each others\\' conversations.\\nthe food is good, but nothing special.\\neven when it wasn\\'t crowded, they wouldn\\'t let our party of three switch to one of the three empty booths.\\nthe staff is generally inattentive and definitely unconcerned. our first waitress, kelly, was nice enough and made a great impression on my niece, who always asks can we go back and visit her, but i can\\'t do it., the food was just ok. the place looked kinda dirty and there were literally cobwebs on the top of the light fixtures. the wait was really long on a saturday morning so don\\'t go if you are in a hurry. not planning on returning., not a bad diner. i ordered the turkey club. the price was reasonable. the service was sub par. 2 waitresses in the place. i noticed a lot of people waiting several minutes at the register to pay. as for cleanliness.... i always take issue with people handling filthy money then touching the bread for toast.. seems to me they could have someone work the register so waitresses aren\\'t contaminating food. i will not be returning., they gave our table away to some folks who knew that staff after we waited a while. not going back., trying to get to all of the area diners and this was my first try at village. prices were reasonable and the service at the counter was very good. however, the food didn\\'t do anything for me. i ordered 3 blueberry pancakes and a side of home fries. the diner was busy nut the food came out in about 10 mins. pancakes were larger  and thick- too thick perhaps as the outside was crispy but the inside undercooked. the blueberries were tough and had no flavor. the home fries are thick potato chips and many were too overcooked to use a fork. my stomach was full by the end but i left disappointed., we noticed the none of the cooking staff was wearing a masks. we asked the waitress about it and she then relayed our question to the manager. the manager didn\\'t have the courtesy to answer our question or even address us., we stopped here because of the good reviews and the delicious looking eggplant parm pic.  unfortunately, parm is off the menu.  i tried the \"capastrami\", but it tasted overly salty.\\n\\nwe also tried the \"bobbie\".  i was surprised it was served cold and not hot.  no fountain drinks.  the only high chair was not very clean.  come here for a typical chain restaurant experience., didn\\'t know it at the time, but this is part of a regional chain that has locations in pa, nj, de, md and some south west states.\\n\\nthis particular shop (located in a strip mall) is pretty bare bones.  yea, there\\'s a huge wall of chips on the wall when you walk in but the walls are otherwise bare.\\n\\nthe hoagie\\'s are pretty good size but lack  a lot of flavor.  when i asked for \"hot peppers\" i was greeted with something i can only describe as \"a collection of red pepper flakes basked in oil\"., a couple of super bowls ago, at an acquaintance\\'s house, i was so impressed by the subs on her party tray that i just had to ask where she got them. but something has happened at capriotti\\'s, at least at the store in exton. the amount of meat and cheese in their \"super bowl 48\" subs has lessened to the point where i won\\'t be returning. they\\'re skimping badly, and the subs are not even close to being worth the price. this seems to be commonplace in the food industry, as a way to lower costs. instead, it will lower their sales., i was highly dissatisfied with the cole turkey i had today. the turkey was sliced round, not roasted and pulled like in the picture on menu. once i was got home to eat i let the management know my concerns. i was told that they gave me the vegetarian version of turkey and was offered me a free sandwich for the next time i go in.  that is what customer service is all about!  i will go back again !!!!!  i knew something wasn\\'t right :), your bobbie was great a few years ago but i can see at the exton pa location you\\'ve been reducing the contents of your sandwiches dramatically over past few years.  most recently we bought 3 giant bobbies november 2020 and there was barely any cranberry sauce in them. the turkey and dressing was very skimpy.  at that same visit we bought a large italian hoagie and it too was very skimpy and had little flavor.   stop making skimpy sandwiches to boost your profits.  the bobbies we got were very thin on contents compared to the photos of them on your website which show very thick layers of food content., i hadn\\'t been to a capriotti\\'s in 20 years because my work was no longer one.  i needed a quick, hot meal and when i saw the capriotti\\'s sign decided that was a trustworthy place.  the service was quick and i got a medium cheesesteak to go.  the price seemed to me on the high side.\\n\\nmy wife stole a quick bite of meat and discovered it had gristle in it.\\n\\ni ate the rest of the cheesesteak and the taste seemed somewhat funny.  i don\\'t think it was good quality meat.  i also ended up with several somewhat large pieces of gristle/cartilage before i finished the sandwich.\\n\\nthis was not the capriotti\\'s i remembered.  i hope this was a one time occurrance., the food was great. the place is in bad need of a facelift and needs to be organized. where\\'s the pride? boxes and stuff everywhere, signs hanging crooked on the wall. two days cleaning and organizing could make the place a better place to sit and have a sandwich. they have three oversized new tvs but filthy trash can about 3 feet from the table where we sat. i have to admit that it makes me nervous about the kitchen. is it clean?, placed a large catering order two days in advance, when i arrived at my specified pick up time they didn\\'t even start my order yet. one of the sandwich makers was very apologetic, and stated she wanted to start the order earlier but was told not to start it until 15 minutes after my specified pick up time.  why on earth would you start an order to feed 100 people after my pick up time?????? she also asked if i still wanted the order, ummm if i am supposed to be serving lunch why wouldn\\'t i want my order????whomever was responsible for the scheduling and prep work the day before really dropped the ball as the sandwich makers were running out of sandwich components while filling my order. one of the trays i ordered was supposed to consist of three different types of sandwiches, it ended up being three of the same.  \\n\\nthey did end up giving me a discount as my order was completed at the time i was supposed to be serving lunch, but i still had a 20 minute drive back. in the end the sandwiches were delicious, next time i would consider going to a different location. my rating is based on my service experience, not the food., off the list used to be super special a treat to go there and eat a massive sandwich. my last order was basically coleslaw and bread sprinkled with meat. $17 wasted. the time before was similar thought it was maybe a bad day, guess it\\'s the new normal, sad to see., awful wait times. sparse ingredients in sandwich. way overpriced for what you get. \\n\\nitalian hoagie- couldn\\'t even tell what kind of meat it contained. very bland taste., i can\\'t even give team one star for my experience was nothing but shameful. i ordered two of the combo platters for my graduation party a total of around one hundred and thirty dollars to have the meat be so dry my guests were taking one bite and throwing the remainder in the trash.  i reached out to the manager of the store and he was so nice and wanted to help but according to the big boss they did nothing wrong and that is how the hoagies are.. so note to anyone who wants a good hogie unless you like all the toppings coleslaw or cranberry sauce prepare for very dry experience.\\n\\nconnie of downingtown, drive a half hour out of my way and they shut the grill off 1/2 hour before closing. kinda frustrating., tried this place a few times since i work nearby. vegetables never taste that fresh and it\\'s overpriced. today, i found a few strands of hair entangled in my salad. that will be my last time coming here. very disgusted., just ate there and am feeling sick. there were lots of flies flying around but the food is kept in the fridge so i am hoping the food is clean.\\n10 min after  eating i got such a bad stomachache that i had to sit down.\\nim praying to god that i dont puke on the amtrak., pretty weak chicken caesar salad. lettuce was browning while the chicken and cheese just tasted off. i work at 30th street and was hoping i could get a semi healthy meal but i was incorrect.\\n\\n$10.05 was a little steep as well., i really don\\'t like to give this restaurant 1 star but back in the day there were 2 previous owners they were the best the previous owner was super clean sam the last owner he was so clean and the food was so amazing but the owner now sorry to say this there nice but they are so dirty there new restaurant look nasty and it stink so bad its like they bought that place and didn\\'t clean it its bad so sad there food use to be so good they should take time and clean up the place and not have there kids in and out the kitchen its not rite., wish i could give this place zero stars. \\n\\nordered general tsos and garlic veggies and they tasted sour, fermented and rancid. when i called to complain the man who answered at me shouted \" this is your first order you don\\'t know how the food tastes\" \\n\\ni asked for our money back since the food was inedible and he shouted \"can\\'t do that. you paid\" \\n\\nafter looking up their health grades, they got docked for food born illness which is probably why it tasted so rancid. \\n\\ni would\\'t order again, not just because the food was clearly old but more so because the man on the phone was a total asshole., the general tsos tasted like sour ketchup. it was also super dry and felt reheated . also, it took way longer than chinese food should take. i honestly wished i had gotten food from the place that i read has bugs-thats how bad this was ., uninspired food served on styrofoam plates. not professional at all., ordered dinner here for pick up a few weeks ago.  i went into get the order.  the delivery guy had a mask on his chin and another woman picking up had no mask on at all.  i stood there like i was in the twilight zone.  the woman working there had a mask on properly.\\nmy hot and sour soup was good but my dinner, general tso\\'s chicken, had zero flavor., i was in mainland this past week with my family and let me just say it was awful. my food was cold and tasted like it was reused from previous days... i didnt mention anything bc the older blonde haired lady..i\\'m guessing the manager seemed very stand offish and rude. i overheard her calling her employees idiots and incompetent to another employee so i decided to not bother complaining. the food was 1000 times better in previous years and the menu now is nothing but fat bar food. bring your old staff back who actually brought ppl in with their cooking annd vibes.. 2 thumbs down...keep trying though.., for a course that only puts sand in the traps where you can see them by the road, i\\'m not surprised they try to get you in the restaurant and bar too. moving my business somewhere else. they just don\\'t get it., not happy to come and find out that the menu changed yet again. they took off gyros and then new menu is ok. not happy that prices have increased yet again in the past year. they are trying to make it seem like this is a 5-star restaurant. it\\'s a grille on a golf course. carry the right foods, listen to your patrons and keep the prices reasonable. i\\'m a frequent customer and it\\'s because i love the bartenders there only. now with all these changes, my visits will shorten alot.   i saw 4 patrons walk out once they saw the new menu.  if you want to run a fancy restaurant then open a location just for that. please remember that you are a bar/ grille., went last night for comedy night.  paid for our ticket sat at the table we were then insulted and harassed by a patron who felt she had the right to tell us we couldn\\'t sit at her table which was not a reserved table.  she called me and my husband names etc.  my husband became angry over the insults and went to find the manager to resolve the issue.  after waiting many minutes he finally showed up and did nothing,  didn\\'t speak to the woman who instigated the whole problem basically did nothing.  we asked for a refund and he didn\\'t know how to refund money on a credit card.  as we were leaving i heard the manager brad insult my husband and myself.  however the bar manager melissa and waitress ashley and the waiter upstairs at the event were top notch the best. due to brads inability to diffuse a situation that could have been easily resolved we will never visit this establishement again or any of our friends.  which is ashame because the rest of the staff is amazing.  they make brad look good because he has no idea what he\\'s doing., they went from 20oz beverages to 6oz beverages for the same price when golfers come off the golf course!!! thirst quencher? not! whose bone head idea is this? wake up!!! better options are not far away..., we used to go for trivia on wednesday nights.  it was packed and fun.  for some strange reason they have stopped doing trivia night.  it would seem a poor business decision as the food isn\\'t something that is a big enough draw without the trivia contest.\\n\\nanyone know where the trivia night moved to ???, \"juicy burger\"  was dry and burned,  not just a \"throw some ketchup on it\" to disguise the taste. you could smell it was burned, like it was dropped into a charcoal grill and pulled out the next day when you dumped the ashes.  was even difficult to cut in half.   notified our server and they did pull it from the bill.   was told to find out when the main cook wasn\\'t on vacation and try again, this wasn\\'t the first complaint they had., my two year old said it best.  this is \"yucky\".  we have lived and frequented mainland for years enjoying lots of different dishes and sticking it out through about 5 different \"new menus\" and chefs.  the newest menu, started the first week of september 2017, was a huge disappointment.  first off, the website did have the new menu but also the bar menu which had some favorites including nachos (one of the reasons why we came so often).  my husband\\'s french dip was okay but a little burned on the outside and the cheese didn\\'t seem to jive with the rest of the sandwich.  i ended up with a southwest salad, which was good, but when i came for the nachos, it lacked some excitement.  it was also quite small for ten dollars and lacked some flavor. my special needs son only eats mac n\\' cheese.  i am sure you parents can relate to the picky factor!  mainland\\'s old mac n cheese was amazing.  even i loved sneaking bites off his plate.  this one had some cavatelli pasta with a \"cheese\" sauce that tasted like it had been cooked too long and then some of the pasta water was mixed with something sort of yellow that resembled (but didn\\'t taste like) cheese.  he literally spit it out. the fries were good.  the beer menu now excludes all the local favorites that it used to have (prism!).  and finally.... the high chair they gave us was broken.  so my son had a ball singing \"the people on the bus went up and down\" as he pushed himself in and out of the high chair.  oh the joys.  overall, after being a loyal customer for nearly five years, we will not be going back.  this is now a \"corporate\" managed restaurant that seems to lack the attention to detail and a taste for good food.  very disappointing., this place has gone downhill fast under new manager. i remember when this place was packed full of patrons,  drinks were good and meals were hot. there\\'s more staff here tonight than patrons. takes forever to get a drink, since bartender is too busy talking. food was barely warm when it arrived an hour after we ordered. not sure what the new manager is doing but whatever it is, it\\'s not working.\\nwe won\\'t be back., new to yelp. this review is from a dinner on 10/12/16 (so may not stand for the experience one might have now 6 months later):  the food was quite nice and inventively prepared.  the wait staff however seemed like they were on loan from a local diner... as did a number of the guests, some of whom were in activewear. i\\'m not particularly snobbish about such things, but we were dressed up based on what we knew of this restaurant and felt quite out of place even tho the interior of the restaurant is very nice. but back to the waitstaff... numerous things were dropped, including my silverware, which the waitress put back on the table for me to use after having been on the floor (serioulsy!) and a large tray of food... not ours. additionally our waitress was unable to open our wine bottle with a normal corkscrew (which seemed pretty incredible given the reputation and price of this place).  we were there for a special anniversary and, altho the food was good, the wine list was only just adequate, and the wait staff was far below what one would expect., wish i could give them no stars. went at lunch time. no slices ready. another man had been waiting for his order for a while. he said 30 mins for pizza. came back in 20 the pizza hadn\\'t even been started yet and now the mans pregnant wife was no inside wondering what was taking so long. guy at register said \"somebody called out\" anyways. never got my pizza. went to popeyes next door., poor quality of food even if the prices are low and small portions. i would not go back sorry, blonde waitress was so rude, barely acknowledged us. eggs were not made to my order, food was barely warm... it was busy, maybe she was having a rough day but no reason to mistreat any paying customers. i\\'ve been here a few times before but this visit is the last., never got to try the food.  arrived 10 minutes prior to closing.  would have done take out given the chance.  was simply told they were closed.  second time this happened.  close 3 on saturday and 2 on sunday., not 4 or 5 star worthy, ok diner food, small. waited almost 30 minutes for breakfast to arrive. will try another local next time., really just didn\\'t have a good experience. the table was filthy we actually had to ask to have it wiped down. the floors were disgusting and sticky. the omelet came out with american cheese microwaved on top instead of cooked inside the omelet. maybe it was a bad day but i wasn\\'t impressed at all., worst service ever! waitresses are slow, rude to customers and completely disinterested in doing their jobs.  waited almost almost 10 min for them to clear even clear a table, then another 10 min to come over to take a drink order. when we said we would like to order because we have been waiting the rude waitress said the kitchen was backed up. needless to say we left along with 4 other parties of people waiting and that saw the poor attitude of the waitress.  staff was arguing with each other about serving tables. don\\'t waste your time supporting a business that doesn\\'t want to serve their customers., wanted lunch on labor day which they were closing early, that is perfectly understandable but the way the waitress barked at us when we walked in the door telling us they were closed was just plain rude., went here for the first time.  cheap/reasonable prices.  food is okay, typical diner menu.  the place is small and seat yourself and apparently busy on the weekends.  there is one major problem.  it\\'s dirty.  i was going to ask the waitress to turn the fan above my table on because it was crowded and a bit hot.  i did not ask, because i looked up to see the filth hanging right above my food, which would have exploded into a tornado of grime dropping on the diner\\'s heads and food if turned on.  if you don\\'t even bother to clean dirt that is plain view your patrons, i can\\'t imagine what is lurking in your kitchen.  clean it up., breakfast was okay. nothing special. lots of food. western omelette was fine. hash browns were terrible, very mushy. the toast was drowned in margarine. coffee was terrible. we waited over 30 minutes for the food., i have frequented koffee korner several times and, have been very satisfied. this was on week days. on weekends, it\\'s an entirely different story. i visited there on the past 2 weekends. the service was awful!! today, i sat for 1/2 hour waiting for a short stack of pancakes and 1 piece of sausage. i will grant you that they were busy. but, as i waited for 2 pancakes and 1 piece of sausage, i watched 2 parties who came in after me get served. that is parties -more than 1 person. i left hungry and paid for my coffee.  that was 1/2 hour! sorry folks but, they\\'re just not built for weekends., would love to give this little restaurant 5 stars because they have good food, however, i can\\'t do that today.  sat at an outdoor table.  our waitress came out, brought drinks and place settings, not wearing a mask.  and yes, she was closer than 6 feet.  we were both wearing masks.  we noticed another waitress inside also not wearing a mask.  we finally decided to check on whether the cook was wearing a mask.  my husband stepped inside and could see the cook in the kitchen not wearing a mask.  the waitress said that they got a letter from the board of health saying they didn\\'t need to wear masks.  well, we all know that is bs.  this was before 1 and they close at 2 - so they weren\\'t getting ready to close.\\ntheir sign on the door says all customer must wear a mask.  i\\'m disappointed and very annoyed that they can\\'t follow the simple guidelines.  we used to like this place., i went for lunch today at this establishment and waitress barely acknowledged me. when i was done, i didn\\'t tip her due to her poor service she had the cook confront me and he was very rude!!!!! i will never go here again. i wish i could give a negative 10., i used to come here a lot a few years back and i loved it, the food was amazing. i decided to stop in for old times sake and it is not even close to being considered good food. the home fries looked old and had discoloration. also had a weird taste, even after i put salt on it. the toast was old stale bread that was heated on the flat top.  i have decided that this is not my \"go to\" place in lansdale anymore which is sad to say because this place used to be great., what a disappointment. this place was not good i would suggest you think twice before selecting this option. the manager and wait staff may possibly be the worst i have ever encountered, rude and definitely not focused on customer service.  the manager is a very angry hostile fella i asked if i could get brown rice instead of white and he blasted me...i offered to pay extra and he stormed off? do not know what the deal was but this is just plain unprofessional and creepy behavior. the waitresses will smack into you while you are eating...man what a mess this place is from top to bottom.\\nthe food just ok at best! i am seriously complimenting them here... you can do better at home than here. seriously i am not going to go into you have been warned just yuk...ok? these other folks with the positive reviews for this place must burn off their taste buds with adult beverages. (didn\\'t try the sake it may be the high point of the joint...but why would i want to expose my taste buds to a substandard meal to enjoy some rice wine? i can do this at home.\\n here is something i am not sure of, i have only lived here a few months now, is it customary to charge for each soda every time you get a refill here? i was charged for each i asked why they said \"this is how we do it here.\" so at $2 bucks per 6-8 ounces of beverage you may want to go with water at this place...but smarter yet! go elsewhere.\\ni will not be returning to this establishment.\\n\\nworst yet., i was always very fond of this restaurant and would regularly go here with my friends. however, last week i came to the restaurant and was double charged. to elaborate, they charged me twice for my order. needless to say, i will not be returning to this restaurant., i\\'ve gone to this restaurant a number of times over the past few years and it\\'s been going downhill steadily.  sushi was fishy and rolls were undersized. there are plenty of other sushi restaurants in the area that would be better choices.  the place is also somewhat stuffy and service is subpar., no. just no. i won\\'t be coming back here. i\\'ve been here once before. the gentleman who might be the owner took my order...a to-go order of a crunchy roll with eel sauce and crunch flakes. it was so yummy. second time around....there are 2 women running the floor. after being seated, we waited for menus. watched a group that was seated after us receive menus and i was so annoyed, i went up and retrieved menus for my table(4 adults, 1 child). i asked the waitress for a similar type roll as i got the last time. what i received was shrimp wrapped in seaweed and rolled in rice. no sauce, no nothing. blah. bland city and not hot at all which is weird because the shrimp is deep fried. my sister ordered the salmon avocado roll....it was not fresh (like we\\'re afraid we\\'re going to be ill later tonight) and room temperature warm. gross. my friend ordered a california roll. you can\\'t mess that up and they didn\\'t. my brother in law ordered a chicken tempura plate. he doesn\\'t have a big appetite for sushi and even he said it tasted like it came from a costco type box. and my 3 year old nephew, who eats anything you put in front of him, was not into any of it. the only thing that came out well was the edamame. ugh. i\\'m beyond annoyed and frankly a bit worried for the state of my stomach after we leave here. i thank god that i live in california where i can experience proper quality sushi! if this is the best sushi this area has to offer, you\\'re all better off just not engaging until you can travel out of the area. my poor sister....no wonder all she wants is sushi when she comes home to visit., super fast but not that great. oil used to fry tempura was old. tuna not bright red, more dark indicating it is not that fresh. gyoza was boiled and soggy.  house salad ginger dressing good. would not return. would rather seek out better options., samurai, what happened to you? it was almost 5 years ago when it seemed like your restaurant was the roaring 20\\'s. i would actually get excited when i\\'d go eat at your establishment. a small, quaint japanese restaurant filled to capacity, sitting at the sushi bar watching the chefs perform their craft. you guys had the best sushi around, no one could touch you and the atmosphere was electric. that all faded away out of no where and i\\'ve finally come to terms that the samurai i once knew has committed seppuku.\\n\\n i came here on a saturday around 8 pm with a friend to a nearly dead atmosphere. there was one couple sitting in the corner... i knew this was a bad sign. the seaweed salad was doable, not as fresh as i remember. the eel, the one thing i knew samurai did right, did not have much flavor. the king crab was like rubber, absolutely no flavor. then came the spider roll.... holy shit. mushy, grainy, fishy, absolutely horrendous. \\n\\ni was personally hurt by this, remembering the quality they used to serve. a piece of me has died with samurai. i\\'ve come to terms with what it now is and i will try to move on., i have been to samuari once before and had a good experience, which i think is important to note. however, a couple friends and i went to dinner here the other night and it was terrible. the sushi and dumplings all tasted good, the service was good and the prices are reasonable. however, 4 of the 5 of us had horrible reactions within hours of getting home which lasted into the next day. a pharmacist described it as a response to eating spoiled fish, a specific kind of food poisoning, that often has symptoms similar to an allergic reaction. while i of course don\\'t think that samuai knowingly served us bad fish, what i am disappointed in is the fact that they did not return phone calls to discuss the matter. responding to a customer complaint of this nature should be a priority and i was extremely let down to contact food poisoning, and then be ignored afterwards. i will not be back. be careful!, having read a number of the previous reviews i was ready for good if not very good sushi. sadly the sushi was average at best with slightly stale taste to it. the soy sauce provided at the table was slightly bitter like coffee and had an undesirable mustiness to it. service was good and attentive and the atmosphere was pleasant., small place and never call the drink. no refill and only half quantity if you ask for a cup of coke. i\\'d rather go to other places. the white tuna is not tasty. but my friend ordered udon and looked good. don\\'t want to go to this place again., ok, i\\'ll admit i\\'m a bit peeved while writing this. \\n\\ni asked for a simple substitution. i expected to pay the difference in price. however, i was charged double the difference. \\n\\nevidently the folks who run samurai sushi feel providing a customer with what they want should come with punitive charges! message to this customer, \"we aren\\'t interested in accommodating your tastes and we are going to punish you for asking for a simple, reasonable substitution. maybe you should find a more accommodating sushi joint.\", i only ate here once and i did enjoy their sushi. however, i don\\'t think i want to come back to this place only because my friend and i felt like the waiters were trying to rush us. we came to this restaurant when they\\'re just open and there\\'s only another table (2 other customers) besides my friend and i. so it wasn\\'t that crowded and busy at all. we felt like we\\'re rush into order the food and even after we just finished the food, the waiter quickly came to our table and asked if we are done and picked up our plates and gave us the check. even at this point there was still no other new customers walking in. the place is literary dead but the waiters acted as if the place is full and busy and tried to hurry us up., extremely unsatisfied with my experience tonight. the sushi is fine but unfortunately their concept of customer service is completely backwards. they charged me triple the price of my roll for substituting the wrapper. not only was i not initially warned of the price change, when i complained two times about the hugely inflated charge, they acted as though they were doing me a favor by giving me an almost insultingly insignificant price reduction. \\nthe sushi is no better than anywhere else on the main line; this will absolutely be the last time i eat at this restaurant., me and a friend ordered from samurai this past weekend and within 3 hours were both extremely ill--two days later and i am just getting over food poisoning from this restaurant. do not order from there!!! this was my first time and i will never go back, i don\\'t like to say bad things about a restaurant because i realize it can affect their business and the employees. i read several negative reviews of this restaurant after my own and would have to agree with many of them. first off the waiter was rude. i didn\\'t hear him ask me(i am slightly hard of hearing) if i wanted a drink and i told him that i needed more time to order and he made it a point to tell me that he wasn\\'t there to take my order but to take my drink order! i thought the salad at $4.25 was small compared to other places i\\'ve been, but the dressing was tasty. i ordered two specials and should have known better to ask the price before, since the price wasn\\'t listed. they charged me $14.95 for a (1) uni hand roll and $8.95 for one piece of super toro. i have been to many sushi restaurants and this isn\\'t the waldorf astoria or tokyo, so $14.95 for a uni hand roll is outrageous!  the \"super toro\" sashimi was ok but a thin slice, so in my opinion, also overpriced. the other sushi, tamago, kani, kanpyo roll, was good. the waiter treated me like a \"gringo\" asking me if i knew the difference between sushi and sashimi and if i wanted a fork instead of chopsticks(a little \"profiling\" there, maybe to see if i would know the difference when they charged me $15.00 for one piece of sushi?). why not just bring both? i complained afterward about the price of the uni and they wouldn\\'t make any concessions, so i am not coming back, as i feel they took advantage of me! for all i know they could have charged me whatever they felt like! moral of the story: always ask the price first and don\\'t feel that you\\'re being chintzy for asking. on top of everything else, they wouldn\\'t take a $400.00 value visa gift card i wanted to pay my bill with! that\\'s b.s.!, maybe i don\\'t understand their \"hibachi\" but this is not the hibachi i\\'ve been eating for the past 10 years of my life., i ordered a hibachi meal here and paid $20 for something my high school cafeteria would be ashamed to serve., i was a regular at samurai for some time. i really enjoyed their food and wait staff. in the last year i feel like it has gone down hill there. they have made their portions smaller, their staff is not as nice anymore and the sushi is not as fresh. i have had to bad run ins with my favorite roll there. every time i go there i always feel sick now. it is not fun get sick from sushi. i still feel like samurai has potential but they need to step it up, a lot. im very disappointed., just about the only place in town to buy caes of beer. poor selection. limited craft beers and soda. worst part is that they charge $1 more per case than other places., i drive several miles out of my way to buy beer here instead of going to bryn mawr beverage.  the prices are markedly lower.  the selection could be better, but they can order anything for you., if you go to blarney on a saturday night, here\\'s what you can expect:\\n\\n- to pay a cover.\\n- to see trashed undergrad girls in cocktail dresses and heels falling all over themselves and anyone who gets in their way.\\n- to pay in cash, as the credit card minimum is $20. \\n- to hear terrible karaoke (this part is actually fun).\\n\\nyou shouldn\\'t expect to:\\n\\n-have space to move around in. it\\'s pack from the front door into the back room.\\n-to have easy access to the bar. the first saturday night i was here, i didn\\'t even get a drink because i physically could not get to the bar. however, i am only 5 feet tall, so i couldn\\'t muscle my way through a wall of frat bro.\\n\\nbottom line: this is a penn undergrad bar, so if that\\'s your scene, go for it. i personally don\\'t like getting dolled up to go to a dive bar, so i take my t-shirt-and -jeans clad self to drinkers\\' west, blockley, or cav\\'s, all of which are way better, in my humble opinion., this place leaves much to be desired... but for an authentic \"traditional college bar\" experience & a cheap pitcher - you can\\'t go wrong.\\nthere\\'s sometimes karaoke or a dj, or people dancing on the pool tables. other times i\\'ve been here and it\\'s completely dead. you never know what you\\'re going to get. one thing is certain - the service isn\\'t very good, and you\\'re better off drinking out of a disposable cup.\\nwill i return? probably... but only for $5 pitchers or $1 wells. ha ha., this bar fucking sucks. no bathroom and staff refused to close the door when it was less than 30 degrees outside., indecisiveness. i left my wallet in my back pocket, sitting on it, my right leg is tingling, going numb. let it. i am trying to go numb. to numb the numbness. so here i sit. indecisive. the crowd grows smaller and louder as the night passes. \\n\\nthe bathrooms are strange and remind me that i, a human, am just an animal, a series of biological processes frantically hurrying towards dissemination and dissolution. \\n\\nseems to be trying for an irish bar vibe? not sure., my two stars could easily be four, depending on who you are.  i think this place is shitty, although the space (minus tvs) and sneaky location are totally my style.  part of the issue:  i think anyplace with a $5 cover for $.50 drinks all night is a bad idea.  so take my review with one or many grains of salt.\\n\\nanyway, the other bad thing about this bar was the food.  the french fries and garden burger we ordered were inedible.  again, we\\'re vegetarians and that informs my experience.  so, what i\\'m saying is that the burger was basically still half-frozen when it came to me and the fries tasted like fried chicken.  now, why do you think the fries might\\'ve tasted like fried chicken?  because everything goes in the same deep fryer, of course!  wings, scrapple, garden burger, fries...it\\'s all going to be cooked partly/wholly in wholesome, death-savory animal fat.  so this place gets a shitty review.  because if i wanted fried chicken i would order fried chicken.  plus, they should really be more careful about cleaning the fryer--this was some seriously unmistakable chicken flavor.  but maybe i should never have come here as a vegetarian who doesn\\'t like $5 all-you-can-drink $.50 drinks...  maybe this is really your dream-bar., this is a frat house for frat boys. case in point, my gin and tonic came in a plastic cup and cost me $2., maybe before your bartenders falsely accuse clientele of breaking pool sticks, they should watch actual security footage to ensure they\\'re talking to the right group of people. the staff here are low-class; no two ways around it. go for ten minutes - anytime -and refute otherwise., it\\'s whatever.  the burger was no better or worse then what i had years ago before the slight makeover and new management.  it appears the service improved.  they have matching shirts, except that one server who didn\\'t do his laundry and likely was wearing yesterdays shirt with last weeks underwear.  gross.  the other food being served looked way better then my burger, but i\\'m very fussy and have to be force fed if its a new food or something i don\\'t like.  not too many things will compare to the sight of a 44 year old, poorly in shape man being force fed french fries on some idle tuesday.  oh, they have beer., just perfectly mediocre pizza, nothing special at all. greasy., three strikes and they\\'re out. sandwiches a big problem. i specifically asked for fried onions on my pickup order of a cheesesteak sandwich the first time - got home and no onions. the second time, a few months later, i ordered an italian hoagie and it was just not good. i threw it away after a few sickening bites. just tonight, i ordered a cheesesteak hoagie, described in the online menu as including onions. i picked it up and when i got home discovered no onions and no cheese. i called them to inform them of these omissions. i was told that \"you have to ask for onions\" (but this was an online order, with no indication that you had to request onions, which were listed as ingredients in the description of the item). furthermore, when i noted the absence of cheese on the cheesesteak, i was told that \"it\\'s mixed in.\" yuk. this reminds me of pink slime-it\\'s a premixed meat-cheese concoction. kind of like brundlefly (see movie the fly, with jeff goldblum). the concept is disgusting. stick with wawa for your junk food urges.  the staff people are nice enough, however. still, wawa - even nicer - and their guilty pleasures are much more palatable., just walked out. $11.27 for a cheeseburger, fries and coke. my only compliment is that they did offer my money back. and the food is ok, nothing special. i wouldn\\'t go back, had bronchitis and pneumonia with no food in the house. called pizzarella grille and they delivered for several days in a row! they\\'re the only ones i trust with my credit card over the phone. they saved my life!!!!!! thanks guys for helping a sick old fool out., we won\\'t be going back here. the prices are way too high... i.e. $14 and up for a large pizza. a few of the simple pasta dishes are good, but not at full price. used to be a half-price pasta dinner menu on sunday nights, which got us in the door to sample a few times, but that deal is gone, and now so are we. there is never anyone dining in this place and the manager/owner looks arrogant and never smiles or says hello to the customers. this place won\\'t be around for long., highway robbery... they raised the price of their gluten free pies by over 30%. no warning about a price increase when i placed my order over the phone. my $12 pie turned into $17. i can understand the gf crusts aren\\'t the cheapest, but for the size of the pies and what you\\'re getting,  they already were at a premium over standard pies. now it\\'s just way out of line,  and i\\'ll not buy again from them. much cheaper to make my own at home., i was with a friend in the area driving around and decided to grab a quick bite.  we just happen to be passing by so se decided to try it out.  the wings were pretty good but the cheesesteaks (we both had different types) were awful.  the bread was hard and neither seemed to have any seasoning and left the whole sandwich very bland.  i wish we would have kept driving and found another place because from what we are it wasn\\'t worth it., if i could give them 0 stars i would. i am 3 minutes away and still took an hour for delivery on a weekday. they would not complete delivery to my condo and delivery guy was a dick. food sucked, threw there menu out immediately. i would rather pizza hut or dominos, this place blows, well i heard they might be under new management and i was working a double and they are close so i figured i\\'d give them a try. staff are very friendly. \\ni ordered a cheesesteak w/ fried onions to go. when i opened the foil wrapper, the roll was terribly soggy. plenty of meat but it did contain some gristle. it was very hot but the american cheese was liquified and imparted no taste to the sandwich. \\nalso, the fried onion pieces were so small they were also tasteless. i couldn\\'t even finish the steak it was so bad. the cook needs to work on his cheesesteak. the ingredients were either low quality or destroyed in the process. i wouldn\\'t go there for a cheesesteak. they have a nice menu and the pastas, pizzas and platters might be very good. i\\'ll have to try their pizza or pasta next time., the food is usually decent here. my coworker and i got a slice of pizza & garlic knots.... can\\'t go wrong there. my coworker couldn\\'t even finish hers. she stated the crust tasted stale. needless to say when we returned to work, we were both sick for the rest of the day. stomach gurgling, etc. never again., nothing really that great here.  the food was ok, but i only made the trip once.  never felt the need to go back, even when i was tired of all of the other local establishments., terrible experience walked in, waited was not attended to and when someone came in after me behind me in line they were taken first. absolutely horrible. i love supporting local businesses but not this one. never again. absolutely ridiculous., this place used to be good but for the past 6 months there\\'s a river of grease in the middle of the pizza and for the last few months they have messed up my orders, most of the time. if you call them to mention they forget the soda, they tell you their deliver didn\\'t come. no explanation for why it\\'s still on the menu and they still collected my money for it. no response on why they missed the dipping sauces again. they charged extra for that too. who wants chicken fingers with no dipping sauces? who wants garlic knots without the marinara you requested. what wants the delivery guy coming to the door instead of honoring the contactless delivery you requested. who wants to pay $4 in fees before your tip, just to get a really disappointing dinner. not me. been a loyal customer for years but it\\'s time to move on. don\\'t waste you time like i did. they don\\'t care., no one wears masks or gloves. shouldn\\'t be open if you aren\\'t going to follow state regulations. even after touching cash, they don\\'t sanitize or wash their hands. dirty place. mediocre food., absolutely the worst saggy gluten pizza i have ever had. such a disappointment. bottom was not cooked. everything just came off the slice the second i picked it up. ugh!, maybe the food is decent and it\\'s great that there\\'s free parking, however customer service can make or break a business. \\n\\nthere was a communication issue, there was a bit of confusion with the order. no one was trying to make your job harder. no one was trying to get one over on you. sure, you probably don\\'t make enough money to have patience with everyone that comes into your establishment. if you don\\'t have enough training to deal with all the different personalities that come into your business ask your boss for suggestions in how to better represent.\\n\\nbeing a business owner in the past, in the food industry i can tell you that the customer is not always right. but never did i or any of my staff treat anyone with disrespect or talk about a customer to another employee while the customer was still present. \\n\\nmistakes happen. think about how you want to be treated or your mother when you spend your money somewhere.\\n\\nthere are tons of pizzerias on the mainline. the food here is decent. but i refuse to give my money for poor customer service., we ordered the food an hour before we wanted it delivered. we requested it be dropped at 4:15. not only is it not but when calling to check if it was confirmed the lady yelled at me and said it was on its way. we r starving and don\\'t want to listen to our teacher talked anymore. i\\'m so disappointed, ordered medium cheese pizza and an italian stromboli for pickup. both were ready upon arrival. pizza was just ok. stromboli was supposed to have ham. capicola, and salami. was overloaded w cheese. it had one slice of what we think was ham and that was it. definitely one of the skimpiest stromboli\\'s we\\'ve ever had. stromboli crust was decent so too bad there was basically only cheese in it. won\\'t be going back., just ordered dinner and the club sandwich had mayo on it. we asked for no mayo. simple accident. asked them to deliver another club sandwich and they said we had to order another one, the cashier went straight from touching my money to putting his hands on my pizza and ground beef did not wash his hands sanitize them or anyting and nobody wears gloves disgusting, my husband went here last night to pick up (3) 12\" cheese steaks (large on their menu) and (2) two orders of plain fries. the bill came to $51.89! here\\'s the kicker, they charge $1.50 for fried onions! are you friggin\\' kidding me? we also added green peppers and mushrooms to ours for another $6.00....wow. so, now the 12\" cheese steak goes from $10.99 to $15.45. that is rediculous. like i said, my husband ran out to grab dinner, if i was there, i would have walked out. i understand an additional charge for mushrooms, even peppers...but fried onions? and at $1.50 per add on, the sandwich should have been loaded...but i had to search for the onions and peppers...i did spot the mushrooms...but i would no way say it justified an additional $4.50 on a 12\" cheese steak. in all fairness, the cheese steak was good, but if i\\'m paying $4.50 to add fried onions, peppers and mushrooms, i shouldn\\'t have to search through the sandwich for them. i\\'d say the peppers and onions were between diced and minced in size. will definitely not be ordering here again. just a heads up too, although the fries at $3.99 didn\\'t seem a bad deal...they sealed them in a round foil pan with a lid..so they were  damp with no crunch at all., sucks. i don\\'t know what else to say. new to the area and gave them multiple chances. wrong order twice, cold delivery with the cheese half slid off.... terrible., do not eat food from here. \\n\\nour usual delivery place closed so we decided to try out somewhere we\\'ve never ordered from before. i\\'m disappointed at how bad this food was. despite the way the food looked (see pics) we spent $30 so we were determined to try and eat this food. #1- they messed up the order. we asked for no sauce on the stromboli but it came swimming in sauce. i asked for ranch with the buffalo chicken fingers and i got blue cheese. #2- the food tasted as terrible as it looked. the chicken fingers came coated in way too much soggy breading with this weird orange hot sauce. the stromboli was soaked in grease and sauce making it soggy as well. the meat inside was gross and very low-grade. the fries came with some nasty orange cheese sauce and tasted like they were cooked in grease that hadn\\'t been changed in quite some time. #3- it came with no receipt so i couldn\\'t see how much we even spent on this garbage. gross, gross, gross. stay away!!, i love chicken cheese steaks. i\\'ve had concord pike\\'s steaks several times before. over the past year, though, quality has taken a huuuuge dive.\\n\\ni recently ordered a large chicken cheesesteak to go, and the chicken tasted like the inside of a freezer- like someone ground up a chicken flavored sponge, popped it in an open ziploc bag, and let it develop freezer burn next to old leftovers from the clinton administration. there was hardly any cheese, so the onions and \"chicken\" just kind of dryly rolled about in the roll, spilling everywhere. the roll was the only good part about the hoagie. \\n\\ni hate wasting food, but i took three bites and threw it (along with nine dollars) in the trash. this wasn\\'t an isolated incident, as i\\'ve gotten a few similar cheesesteaks that have tasted like freezer burn in the past year, hoping each bad order was just a fluke. never again., hands down one of the worst cheesesteaks around . borderline inedible . whatever meat they use is trash, pizza review: burnt top and super thin crust. bar pizza is much better! \\ncheesesteak review: tastes good but... not much meat on it. got the $9 special.  supposed to be a large. the roll is large. yet, as you can see from my photos, the actual steak is sparse and the ends of the roll are empty.  disappointing because it did taste good. 2 reluctant stars only because cheesesteak tastes good., really disappointed, this used to be the best cheese steaks around now they are mediocre. plus their prices went up under the new ownership . i got two regular cheesesteaks and my bill was 26!!!! that\\'s crazy . i order from primos, cappriottis and delcos original...at least they have great food and the sandwiches are huge for the prices. you can\\'t charge specialty sand which shop prices with food you can get anywhere . will not be going here again., i ordered an italian hoagie but i should have ordered a ham & cheese hoagie. the hoagie was loaded with ham on top and there was a thin layer of capicola and salami on the bottom. i didn\\'t see or taste any prosciutto. they charge $9.00 for a small (8\") italian hoagie which is a $1.00 more than a ham & cheese. definitely overpriced. i can go to another shop and get a 12\" italian hoagie loaded with capicola, salami,  prosciutto and sharp cheese for $8.65. i did like the roll. it was firm which prevents it from getting soggy. my family ordered cheese steaks. they said they thought they were average. nothing to rave about. they expected more because of the price. we most likely will not be returning. we expected more bang for our buck., omg! i just picked up a larg plane pizza. it was the worst pizza i ever had!  it was like the kind of pizza you get at a carnival no sauce the crust was thin as a piece of paper all dough no cheese. eww you\\'ve been warned! we threw it out., we recently took 8 family members to cvge for dinner.  this was my second visit, the first was really good. this one was not nearly as good and sadly, will probably be my last. my wife and i really wanted to like this place. \\n\\npositives - creative menu. the waiter was very polite and attentive. drinks were great (nice bourbon cocktails).  beer selection was also good. prices are reasonable. \\n\\nnegatives - most of the food was poorly done, despite a very long wait time. every one in our party complained about the over use of salt. the fried chicken was inedible due to the salt and funky taste in the batter (something was definitely off). the waiter apologized but made no effort to remedy the issue.  the chicken was left untouched on the plate. the bacon used on the grilled cheese and burgers had too much fat. the sweet potato fries were overly cooked. an overall poor performance from the kitchen.\\n\\ni am assuming they were having kitchen issues (it was the day after new year). but consistency is key and they dropped the ball., went there for an early dinner on a sunday. we left disappointed with the food and service. originally, we were impressed by the reviews on yelp and we had passed it a couple of times when we were dining in that area before. i was actually looking forward to dining here...when we arrived, we were seated quickly. there was one other table with customers but they were just leaving. the staff was standing at the bar watching/cheering a game on a tv over the bar. \\n\\nour server was friendly but seemed distracted. we ordered the crawfish dip, a couple of beers, buttermilk chicken sandwich, mac n cheese, and the chocolate cake for dessert. the appetizer took about 20 mins. to arrive...they did eventually come out to tell us something was wrong with the oven and they would remove it from our check out of courtesy. we were then served our meals and about 15 mins later, our appetizer arrived. \\n\\nthe buttermilk chicken sandwich: the chicken itself was soggy and/or very greasy, the kale or greens on the sandwich were soggy from being soaked in honey or grease maybe?? it looked unpleasant. normally, greasy wouldn\\'t be so bad with a nice crunch. this didn\\'t have that. the mac n cheese had a good smokey flavor from the bacon. the crawfish dip had good flavor as well...very cheesy and tangy. the bread it came with was toasted and slightly burnt around the edges. it was hard to chew or cut. before we were asked if we wanted dessert, our server brought us the check. maybe he wanted us to leave so that they can all continue watching the game without interruption, but it was strange. we asked if we can order dessert and he took our order. the chocolate cake was dense...a huge portion that was good for sharing. not sure if the cake was stale or just hard from being refrigerated but it was hard to cut with a knife. i actually thought it might be frozen but it wasn\\'t.  it had good flavor though. \\n\\nso, it wasn\\'t a horrible experience but with all the dining options in and around philly, we will not be returning even if it was an off night for them. \\n\\nsorry! :(, stopped in on a saturday night that wasn\\'t particularly crowded.  service was definitely slow - 45+ minutes for entrees.  our table was overflowing with empty glasses and plates - not bus service to make room or clear dishes.  had to track down our waiter to get our check at the end of the night.  ordered the $14 lamb burger medium rare that came out gray, dried out and seriously overcooked.  would have sent it back but just took too long to make the first one. other entrees for dining companions were 2-3 star.  beers (tap) were $7-$8 each.  do yourself a favor - go next door to mcmenamin\\'s and get a better selection of beer, for more realistic pricing, and a $9 burger that is twice the size of what they serve here., here\\'s my dilemma. we want this place to succeed, it\\'s local, good food, great ambiance, friendly wait staff. but i am sitting here right now in a half empty restaurant with my husband (happy father\\'s day!) and my 5 year old and 9 month old and we have been waiting an hour for our food. an hour!!! with kids!! the waitress is being so lovely about it, very apologetic etc, brought us a free appetizer, but still. about 6 weeks ago we had the same experience here, long waits for food, mixed up orders, apologetic wait staff. what on earth is going on with management? it\\'s like they are 3 people short back there. we waited 20 minutes for bread! please don\\'t fail, cvge. please just replace your management staff., hi! my husband and i typically enjoy our time at the cvge. having been a restaurant worker myself, we are patient with the sometimes slow service. on the night of sept 21st we tried to dine there and we ended up walking out. we were seated inside, and all the other tables were already served or finishing up their meal when we sat down. we were not acknowledged at all. we waited for 10-15mins. no one said hello or bring us water. the waitress brought the table next to us their check and attended to them multiple times.  she then proceeded to clean the table on the other side of us. all the while, not a glance at our table or interaction with us at all. we did not want to make a scene, so we got up to leave. as we were leaving, the woman behind the bar greeted us goodbye. she noticed i had a unhappy expression and waved me toward her. i said to her \"we were not waited on\". she was apologetic and asked if we would like to sit back down and she will get someone for us. at that point we were so disappointed we elected to leave and we ended up dining elsewhere that night. rarely do i feel the need to write such a note to about a food establishment, but i was truly shocked at the lack of attention we got as patrons last night. i tried reaching out to you via fb messenger, and because i did not want to leave you a poor public review because we like cvge. given i did not get a response via fb messenger, i feel compelled to inform you of our lackluster experience and i hope that it was an isolated incident., let me set this up: party of 6 adults with 2 very young children on father\\'s day at 530pm at a empty-ish dining room \\n\\nno high chairs available... evidently they only have two \\n\\nno changing table... which means i had to used the floor\\n\\nour meal took 45 minutes and was not all presented at the same time (3 dishes delivered and then 10 minutes later 2) and then the last two meals did not arrive until after everyone else had finished.  \\n\\ntwo of the meals were not prepared correctly. \\n\\nwe were not offered anything for the kiddos to consume to make them happy. \\n\\nit was really just horrible service and not kid friendly. i love hipster-ness but if you own a shop in mt airy you should be able to accommodate families. \\n\\ntoo much pepper. i love seasoning but calm down. \\n\\nmy out of town guests were not pleased, i have tried this place several times with very mixed results.  service has been great one evening, not so much the next time.  the food has ranged from bland to excellent.  a couple of weeks ago my family and i decided to give it another try only to be turned away.  when we walked in, the hostess explained that she couldn\\'t seat us because \"the kitchen was backed up.\"  the restaurant was not full.  it seems like bad management is to blame for these inconsistency issues.  what a shame., vegetarians beware-the vegetarian menu has meat. it makes no sense. one side clearly is their regular menu that has meat. the flip side claims it\\'s vegetarian but the meatloaf is not a mock meatloaf-it is meatloaf. their soup has beef stock. it\\'s all just a joke on us-will never go back-, front of house service was good but food was really disappointing, almost everything at our table of 6 was bad.  chicken sandwich was scrawny and tasted like fish oil, sweet potato fries undercooked, burger unseasoned and undersized, even the kids complained their chicken tenders were dry and \"tasteless\" (which i confirmed).  only good thing was mac and cheese, which was way overpriced at $10 for a small side. i overheard the table next to us complaining how bad their food was and getting items removed from their bill, which i didn\\'t have the heart to do, but i won\\'t be back anytime soon unless just for drinks (which were fine)., i ate here last night for the first time, and was underwhelmed by the food. the fish sandwich i had was tasty, but the sweet potato fries tasted just wrong (like they were fried in the bad oil), and they remained uneaten on my plate. my friend said his cauliflower buffalo bites were mediocre (he\\'s had better). ambience-wise, it was really loud, even after the waitress had the music turned down. i prefer restaurants where you don\\'t end up with a sore throat the next day because you spent the evening shouting to be heard across a very small table. our server was pleasant and prompt. and the decor is nice., i had avoided this place since its opening some time ago.  then it was a weird menu of badly cooked items with strange beer offerings. much has changed since then.\\na recent order of two farmhouse burgers were pretty good.  one was overcooked, the other was right on.  both came with a pile of well cooked fries. altogether it was too much to finish. i believe that the menu price was $13.00; might have been $15.00. either way, its a good price for a lot of food. there were several other menu items that were appealing. \\n\\nthe beer program is definitely better, but could still use some work in my opinion. the beers seem to be either insipid lagers, or low-profile brewery offerings that just don\\'t seem well thought out.  raspberry stout, anyone? ah,no, don\\'t do it.  this beer lacks balance, and is not food friendly. the ipa currently on offer is better than the stout, but there is the same non-food-friendly issue with hoppy beers. \\nhere\\'s a suggestion: if the grain exchange wants to be independent with its beer choices, how about not going with an ipa at all?  there ought to be at least one bar in philadelphia without one. and, hey guys, can you please put the menu online?\\n\\nthere is an inviting patio for good weather. the staff is friendly and attentive.  i\\'d like to be able to consider a 4th star. i\\'ll be back to try other items, and possibly to upgrade this review., visited this place on a recommendation from a friend and wasn\\'t impressed at all. i ordered the shrimp and grits and asked the waiter if it was a white or brown sauce. to which she replied brown. well when my meal came there wasn\\'t a sauce at all. it was simply a plate of grits with a bout 4 or 5 grilled shrimp sitting on top.  considering the fact that i was visiting phili for the weekend and quite hungry i was tremendously disappointed.  i don\\'t think i will be returning on my next phili trip., great food. drink orders took forever, and for a while my table of 5 were the only ones there. at the end of the meal they informed us that they could only take cash because their machine was down. didn\\'t offer to take an imprint the old fashioned way. nope, they said that there was an atm down the street. we were having torrential rains, and we were told to go get cash. a friend said this happened to him before. \\n\\nnot worth the trouble., we liked this place when we went about a year ago. we went back last night and will not return. patio was closed- because the dining room was not yet filled up. \\nno fried chicken until \"after 7\"\\nloud environment \\ncramped tables. \\nmediocre food- i had a burger that was no better than the trolley car., came at 8:00 on a saturday, seated outside. no one else there and empty tables inside. waitress took our order quickly then returned 30 minutes later telling us our food would be out soon. she returned 15 minutes later telling us that the kitchen said our food had been sent out already. as if we had already eaten it and we\\'re trying to get away with something. she reordered it, 20 minutes later we had our food. an ordinary burger and a crab cake sandwich that tasted like paste. the waitress offer a dessert to try to make up for the delay. the check arrives $45.00 for two sandwiches and a 12$ beer?!?!  no price on the beer list, no heads up from the waitress when ordering. crappy evening and food was not the waitresses fault, it\\'s the restaurant at fault. save your money for good food someplace else., i used to love this place but the last3 times i\\'ve gone its not been good. they messed up the order twice,and the waitress didn\\'t even seem to care. also one of my friends food was cold and we told the waitress and she wasn\\'t very nice about having to send it back stating\"it may be a while hope you\\'re not hungry\"and she didn\\'t say it in a joking manner. i\\'ve worked in restaurants and what she should have done was got my friend an appetizer on the house or a drink or something. then the bill was messed up one time,plus the food was not what it used to be. i hope theycan get back to what they had as i used to love coming here but after my last few experiences me nor my friends will be back., visited chesheim after three visits and i unfortunately have to say it was horrible. to start, my bf asked to taste two beers on tap. the waiter showed up with full size beers that we decided to drink anyway because he clearly didn\\'t listen to the request. we visited with my daughters and asked for a kids brunch menu. he let us know he could make any brunch menu item in a kids portion. he showed up with regular portions when the food came out. we asked for the check and realized we were charged adult prices for their meals. i asked him about it and he shrugged and said, \"yeah\".... after waiting 15 minutes he finally came back and ran our card for the bill. service is very important to me and i have to say this visit is enough for me not to return. the restaurant was not full at all during peak brunch hours. there is a reason for that. i won\\'t be surprised if they are not in business for another six months., a partner and i had dinner at the grain exchange recently. in summary, we had one good dish, one bad dish, and very mediocre service. didn\\'t feel it was a good value for the price. details follow. \\n\\nfirst, the restaurant is very small, and they don\\'t take reservations for parties of less than six. so you will be waiting a while for a table. (in the summer they have additional outdoor seating, but in the fall/winter that doesn\\'t work.) \\n\\ni had the tasting board which was a nice selection of (mostly fried) appetizers, but a bit pricey at $17. my partner had the bacon and brie grilled cheese, which sounds promising, but was horrible because they put uncooked bacon in the cheese sandwich before grilling, which resulted in a sandwich with nearly-raw bacon inside, and bacon grease all over the place. this dish might work if they cooked, or partially cooked, the bacon before putting it in the sandwich and grilling. this disaster was $13. \\n\\nselection of craft beers and wines was very good. service seemed very rushed, and missed obvious things like clearing the table, leaving dirty dishes on the table after dinner, through presenting the bill, and collecting payment. the dirty dishes were still there when we left. can\\'t remember the last time that happened to us in a restaurant. \\n\\nthis place has some potential, particularly in the vegetarian menu, and a nice location. now if they could just smooth the rough spots from the menu and train the servers a little, they\\'d have something., i\\'m  taking away a star from my local place. hate to do it, but the place looked filthy -- cobwebs all over. i may not be able to see the kitchen, but i worry about hygiene when the indoor seating areas look like they haven\\'t seen a good cleaning in months!  too bad, because i enjoy the newer menu items such as the open faced salmon sandwich., they are getting two stars only because the menu looked amazing and i would have loved to eat here.  we arrived a little after 8 pm, sat outside because it was very noisy inside and then waited for our server.  after about 10 minutes someone finally showed up to welcome us and take our drink orders.  the drinks took a while to come because they did not have the beer my husband wanted and he had to reorder.  we then placed our order which included a cold appetizer, two salads and a shared plate.  25 minutes later, we were still waiting on our cold appetizer of pickled vegetables with bread.  needless to say, we canceled everything and asked for the bill as we were on a reasonable time table with our kids coming home.  the excuse we got was that there were two large parties ahead of us, so i guess our money doesn\\'t matter.  they brought the bill without even trying to make it better or even compting us a drink.  i mean come on, your pour us 4 ozs of wine each and you can\\'t even give us one for free after we have the inconvenience of trying to go on a date night and not even getting food.  the final nail in the coffin, is that i go to look at an uncleared table the entire time, a half eaten burger with fries and other trash.  so disappointing, as we live in neighborhood and really like to support local business., this place needs some serious rethinking. food was very pricey for what it was and nothing was prepared well at all. the menu is huge, i don\\'t see how they can make any profit with a menu of this size without a ton of volume, which also explains the lack of care and thought put into preparing the food. bar tender seemed really annoyed at life...perhaps he wishes he lived and worked down town? the hostess was very nice, the only good thing about this place unfortunately. changes are needed here big time., this place is basic as f. it might look hip and \"with it\" in so far as their bogus craft cocktail, craft beer and whatever scene they\\'re going for but don\\'t be fooled. the only thing they have going for them in the food department is their seitan wings and i\\'ve had better. for brunch i got a brown and grey omelette. for dinner once i got soup that was bland but made it halfway to my standards with the texture. last night was the last chance. i ordered two of the same cocktail. the first person didn\\'t know how to make it, used bottom shelf gin but charged me the full price of the primo drink i ordered. the second time it was made by someone else and i think that was the proper way it should have been made but who knows?! at grain exchange it\\'s a crapshoot of guessing games for all! then being told that our hard ass french fries were \"supposed to be like that\" when they came out dark brown, hard enough to chip my teeth on and overcooked. it was our fault of course not knowing what shoestring fries should taste like. ok bro and lady that doesn\\'t know what orange bitters are. they corrected it but i didn\\'t like them trying to make us take responsibility for their mistake, double basic-b! like if you guys can\\'t get fries right, you\\'re more basic than i thought. anyway, temporarily the grain exchange is fooling mt. airy\\'s walk score with this ruse of a cool vibe but you have to do more than prop up gentrification to prevent all of your customers from realizing they should have gone to mc menamin\\'s instead. it literally had 5 times the amount of people in there and their fries were a thousand times better.  everyone had food and drinks and no one was complaining about anything. grain exchange will forever struggle to pay their interior decorator bill and then shut down within a year if they don\\'t improve their standards to at least diner-level soon., what can i say. it was the fourth time i was there. the first two experience were wonderful. food was great. the services was at times slow, but pleasant. i took my friend there yesterday. our waiter had only been there a week or so he mentioned after he pulled up a chair next to us to sit down as he told us the specials and that he worked until midnight the previous day and woke up at 6am that morning so he was very tired. along with the fact that he has had a heart attack and cancer in his past. i thought..this is quite a character. i wasn\\'t too put off by the over sharing but when he mentioned that a girl had ordered the vegan seitan pulled pork and he shrugged off the fact that he ordered the pulled pork sandwich for her, because he obviously wasn\\'t the slightest bit familiar with the menu. apparently when she bit into it and called him back to say this was very porky, only to then realize his error. i was shocked, not at the error really as much as he didn\\'t care that he goofed. well fast forward. i never got my iced tea. we cancelled the seitan wing appetizer because it was on it\\'s way-after our meal was served. the waiter didn\\'t stop by once to see if we were happy. it was the sweet guy that brought out the food that confirmed that my order of macaroni and cheese w tempeh bacon truly was tempeh and not the real thing. i asked for our bill. told the waiter to make sure the iced tea and wings weren\\'t on the bill. he seemed confused by the fact that we never got the items. he said he\\'d bring it right away but instead he hid in a room where we could clearly see he was eating and talking to the hostess instead of getting our bill. we stood up to speed him up. of course the wings were on the bill. i told him to take the wings off. at that point i had, had it up to \"there\" and told him this was the worst experiences i\\'d had there. he just apologized about 4 times and we were on our way. i got so revved up and annoyed. it will likely be a good 6 months before maybe, being willing to go back there. and that would only be to get their biscuit which is amazing., the grain exchange is a rip in the fabric of space-time. \\n\\nthe bartender at this establishment is what you would get if a sloth mated with an ent. he checked on us once, then ignored us for the next hour and a half while we waited for food that never came. \\n\\nwe sat at the bar because the host didn\\'t have the creativity to seat our party of 3 at the 2 free 2-tops in the dining area. \\n\\ni am on yelp writing this as my wife looks up other establishments in the area. we are nearing 2 hours in, we have had one drink and no check-in to see if we want anything else. our food order has been in for at least an hour. never again. we are walking out. \\n\\ndo yourself a favor and never come to this black hole of a restaurant., to be fair, i can\\'t actually rate the food--after having to wait about 20 min. to order and a further 70 without seeing any sign of my food or receiving any communication from any of the waitstaff, i left., we should have known better when the waitress informed us that they were out of tofu and seitan but we settled on the veggie burger. it had absolutely no taste and had a strange paste- like texture. another in our party ordered the mac and cheese with bacon that was equally as horrible. bacon barely cooked and no spice at all. we ate the avocado and the buns and called it a day. do not waste your money at this place- instead take your money to trader joe\\'s where you will get twice as much and food that tastes like something., i took two guests there for dinner. i ordered the appetizer sampler, which was supposed to be andouille sausage, cajun shrimp, pimento cheese, fried pickles, fried green tomatoes,and homemade almond crackers. they brought it to the table, and left it without saying a word. it did not have either the cheese or the fried green tomatoes. \\n\\nwhen i let them know they forgot the cheese and tomatoes, they checked with the kitchen, came back to our table and said that the reason it did not come with the cheese and tomatoes was that the ran out. period. i asked how you could advertise that it came with these things (for a $19 appetizer,) take our order without mentioning that you don\\'t actually have the things i ordered, or at the very least once the kitchen realizes that they do not have the food  come back to our table and ask if we wanted to order something else, or would like to substitute something for the missing items?\\n\\nthe manager then came over and added more shrimp and sausage to make up for the missing items  (the \"homemade almond crackers\" had already been substituted with cut up pieces of plain toast, which they made no mention of.) \\n\\ni then asked the waiter about their \"hot chicken,\" to make sure that i could get it grilled, as i cannot eat fried chicken, to which he said yes you can get it pan seared. of course they brought me fried chicken! i sent it back, and refused their offer to bring me something else. \\n\\nthe atmosphere was nice and so were the people, but they tried to rip us off with the appetizer, and made the wrong food. after taking my guests out for dinner - i had to stop and get take out on the way home! dishonest and incompetent service - never again!, i came here on a first date and though past experiences here had been enjoyable, this one was lacking to say the least... the waiter was extremely charismatic and outgoing at first but then ended up being pretty inattentive toward the end. there are two sides of the menu - vegetarian and regular. i ordered the pear salad from the vegetarian side of the menu not realizing that it was on both sides. the waiter didn\\'t ask me to specify which one i wanted. one bite into the salad, i realized it wasn\\'t tempeh bacon. my date went to track down our waiter to put in a new order, but he never came back to check on us. he ended up being standoffish and my date had to track him down again for the check. before this past experience here i would recommend this restaurant but now i don\\'t feel much of a desire to go back., overall very disappointing. been hearing about this place from a friend so wanted to give a try for takeout.\\nthe servers/host inside were nice but settled very unorganized.  \\nfried pickles were the worst i\\'ve had. veggie burger was a giant blob (probably a half pound) of beans and corn, and whatever was being used as a binder was not even cooked through as it was stretchy and a weird pasty texture. gross. ended up getting rid of it completely and just eating the tempeh bacon on the bun. \\nsuch a bummer as the menu looked interesting and i\\'d have gone again but this was just very inedible., this restaurant is straight up the middle. it doesn\\'t seem to be trying hard to hard to impress by design hoping that it\\'s location and a lack of alternatives nearby will carry the day. two separate visits left me underwhelmed as both the burger and the grilled cheese sounded good on menu but  will not be worth a repeat trip. the avalanche of fries they were served with were the best part but probably half a portion would have sufficed.\\n\\nthe grain exchange instead of humble just feels tired, already a relic that you can point out to others what a restaurant from 2014 was like. big burger (with optional fried egg and tomato compote) anchoring the menu...check. slightly overpriced cocktail program..check. mason jars? oh boy., ordered for take out, had two things wrong with my order, i asked to not have the kale on the sandwich(i\\'m not a big fan) -& for an extra side of the mayo, i received neither request. also the shoestring fries were just limp strips , not very tasty. the chicken sandwich was really juicy though but the bun didn\\'t stand up to it maybe a more dense bread would work better., long wait. only decent food. nothing stood out about the farmhouse burger. sweet potato fries were hard (not crunchy...just hard). my husbands rib sandwich was soggy. \\natmosphere was ok...kind of loud and cold (though it was really cold outside too). \\nprobably won\\'t go back., food is mediocre but menu is inflexible and the wait time for the food after ordering is very long, the good: the food was actually pretty good. better than what i was expecting. \\nthe bad: be prepared to wait a looooooonnnnnnnggggggg time even if its empty. \\n\\ni am totally ok with the food here, in fact if the service was better, i would gladly come back. that said, we got there around 1pm on saturday and were seated immediately (because it was pretty empty). then the wait started... it took literally 20 minutes for the server to acknowledge that we were there. he brings us some water and comes back 5 minutes later. then after us waiting 25 minutes since being seated, he asked if we wanted to put in a drink order. i knew if i did not order everything right then and there, i was going to be in for another 40 minute wait, so we ordered everything we wanted. \\n\\nunfortunately, we still waited that 40 minutes before we were served... the part that really gets me is that they brought the appetizer at the same time as our lunch. who does that? why not break up the time by sending us the app between the time we got our drinks and got our lunch? \\n\\nagain, the food was good, no complaints there, but the service needs to spend less time hanging by the hostess area talking about things and more time making sure their tables are being attended to. 65 minutes to get fed is unacceptable in a partially empty restaurant and its sad to say that i am not going to go there again., we had dinner here tonight and was very disappointed in the food and service. we were a party of 6..reasonable we thought. we needed to ask the waitress for every single we needed...plates, napkins, silverware for our apps...salt a pepper, napkins, sugar..everything. they brought a small carafe of water to the table...after asking 3 times...clearly not enough for 6 people. we needed to keep bringing the carafe inside for refills. the food took a long time to be prepared and was not worth the wait. every plate had the wrong sides on it. the fried chicken was very good. the salmon arrived cold and overdone. to add insult ...an 18% gratuity was added...not unexpected with our size party but aggravating with such poor service. did not enjoy our meal and will not go back!, good food, not amazing. had the fried chicken and my husband had the short rib. horrible service. our waiter was also the bartender and he seemed like he hated his job. took away from what could have been a positive dining experience. very very very slow service and the place was empty at the time. shame, has such potential., honestly i would have been less offended if someone just took a dump on a plate. get your act together grain exchange. one star for consistently- terrible-everything. the people that work for you are nice people who project job unhappiness onto customers because they\\'re probably treated like crap from the top down. we don\\'t blame them we blame you. this place could be awesome but it\\'s super disappointing every time. tonight is the first time our bill was comped and we accepted -- but really we feel like grain exchange owes us around $200+ from multiple bad experiences. finally, never again going here and will be warning others., the food was disgusting. they were out of hash browns, whipped cream, and a bunch of other stuff. the food was all dry and greasy. the portions were small. not going back., when zero stars is too kind\\n\\naround 12:44 pm today i ordered what i expected to be lunch from grain exchange via caviar.  i have not gotten food from there in a long time, but i remembered they had good roasted vegetables, and i wanted something on the healthy side.  i ordered their roasted vegetables that are supposed to come with rice and beans, and that are not cheap $17, and vegetarian mac-n-cheese for my son.  the first attempt comes and it\\'s something that looks like shrimp and grits.  fortunately i looked in the bad right away while at the door and handed it right back to the driver.  he went back to take care of it.  replacement order comes and it\\'s a ton of rice, no beans and a handful of vegetables.  and not vegetarian mac-n-cheese.  they sent the one with real bacon. so i wasted over two hours to still be starving.  everything just went in the trash, because i didn\\'t trust the rest.  never again., this used to be a favorite spot. dependable food, good drink menu, friendly service. however, recently their food has been disappointing. they have a monday burger special (1/2 price) that has drawn us in a few times. the last two times, the burgers have been so well done they were almost inedible. the first time this happened, i sent my burger back twice. the third version was also overcooked, but i was starving by that point. the most recent time we went for burgers (i was craving burgers and thought we would give them another chance), i ordered a rare burger and it came out like a hockey puck. what is the point of asking how you want something cooked? we won\\'t be fooled into their burger special again., hate to give a bad review, but... i feel like i\\'m obligated. we just left. there were about 15 people in the entire place. we ordered: 1 seltzer, 1 sprite and 1 beer. after 30 minutes, and a reminder, we received 1 beer, a seltzer with way too much lemon juice (in place of sprite) and no seltzer. i let it go. it took another 45 minutes for our food, mediocre at best. i ordered clams (sandy) and a little cold. my wife had a shrimp po-boy, basically bread. my son ordered a burger, he did like it. i will add that the wings weren\\'t bad. we asked if there was anything gf on the menu, they\\'re response? order what you want. that meant the kitchen wasn\\'t responsible. that\\'s fine, however, saying: there is a shared fryer, etc, is a better way to explain. we had to go up to the bar to ask for the check and we received just how much we owed, it didn\\'t have what we ate listed... odd. i paid asap and left.  i get it was busy and that you were short staffed, but yikes! i spent $70., i wanted to love this place from the get-go, but some fundamental things need to be improved before it\\'s really great. \\n\\nmy husband and i came on a late afternoon, albeit kind of a random time, but that really shouldn\\'t have a bearing on the quality of our experience - however it did. we were the only people in the place and still couldn\\'t hear each other because the staff were talking and joking around so loudly. at one point an employee ate a wawa sandwich in the dining room; it just seemed unprofessional. i get that there\\'s a certain amount of restlessness that occurs before a busy shift, but come on... \\n\\ntheir cocktail list was an impressive selection of what promised to be finely crafted drinks, including art in the age spirits. i had the rosemary\\'s dog (gin with grapefruit) which was one of the worst drinks i\\'ve ever tasted. if i had to guess, it seemed like it was made with bottom shelf gin that had a rosemary sprig sitting in the bottle for a year. grapefruit flavor was non-existent. all in all it tasted like dirty water. my husband\\'s craft beer was delicious though. maybe i should have ordered an aita drink?\\n\\nwe had the smoked gouda mac and cheese which was tasty, but again, over-promised and under delivered. i could swear it was made with plain american cheese, no smokey gouda flavor whatsoever. \\n\\nfinally, the farmhouse burger with fries. looked great and was very juicy, but was a hot mess to eat. the potato bun could just not stand up to the massive burger and toppings. chef needs to watch the heavy hand with salting the fries. \\n\\ni\\'m not writing this place off yet, i think there\\'s a ton of potential. i just hope the owner takes some of the yelper feedback to heart and continues to make this a great addition to the neighborhood!, update: immediately after posting the review below the owner reached out to me to resolve the issues. long story short, after seeing my review, they added a kid\\'s brunch menu. i appreciated ownership being open to feedback and willing to enhance customer experience based on that feedback. i haven\\'t had a chance to visit again but plan to in the future now that they are a kid friendly restaurant in a family oriented neighborhood. \\n\\nvisited chesheim after three visits and i unfortunately have to say it was horrible. to start, my bf asked to taste two beers on tap. the waiter showed up with full size beers that we decided to drink anyway because he clearly didn\\'t listen to the request. we visited with my daughters and asked for a kids brunch menu. he let us know he could make any brunch menu item in a kids portion. he showed up with regular portions when the food came out. we asked for the check and realized we were charged adult prices for their meals. i asked him about it and he shrugged and said, \"yeah\".... after waiting 15 minutes he finally came back and ran our card for the bill. service is very important to me and i have to say this visit is enough for me not to return. the restaurant was not full at all during peak brunch hours. there is a reason for that. i won\\'t be surprised if they are not in business for another six months., i\\'ve given this place a chance but aside for the main bartender the place and food is mediciocre at best. the food is inconsistent since things like pita toast and burger buns come out cold, the food itself is bland and the menu is grossly overpriced for the quality., bad food.  mediocre service. barely clean dining area. way too expensive.  never again., we had such a disappointing experience here last week (6/16). i had been once before and had a great time, so i brought my sons with me, thinking they would enjoy the menu. both service and food were underwhelming. we couldn\\'t even drink away our disappointment, since once the food finally arrived, our server never came back to ask if we needed anything. we were thirsty, frustrated, and underwhelmed. we ordered appetizers (these came promptly and were freshly plated and hot), a range of small plates and an entree. the waitress asked us if we wanted them all at the same time and we said we did so that one person wasn\\'t eating alone. i think she might have forgotten to tell the kitchen this, though. after a long wait, again with no one thinking to tell us that our order was coming or asking us if we would like more drinks, our dried out, cold meals arrived. cold poutine with bad french fries is completely unacceptable. even the baked beans that came with the rib dinner were dried out. my sons are athletes in their early 20s and are always hungry. even they didn\\'t want to eat the food. i can\\'t remember the last time i ate somewhere that cared less about my experience. you can do a lot better in mt. airy. go up the street to earth bread & brewery. i wish we had., this is getting 3 stars because of the atmosphere and cool vibe. but the food certainly doesn\\'t live up to its hype. the fried pickles were soggy and bland, the chicken and barley soup needed seasoning badly, and the brie, pear, onion, bacon grilled cheese was truly gross -- the pear was unripe and had a terrible texture and the brie was flavorless. moreover, the sandwich was super greasy and super salty -- this must be where all that needed seasoning went. the beer choices were ipa-heavy and uninteresting. my husband enjoyed the farmhouse burger and sweet potato fries., tried this place out the other day for the first time because it seemed to be rated fairly well here on yelp. what a disappointment. we sat outside in a nice enough little side yard and the server was excellent. if not for the service being so good, i would give this place the lowest possible rating. \\n\\nwhat was so disappointing for me was that i ordered their brisket and it was just pure disgusting. i think it may even have made me ill. they had some kind of a burger special running that evening, and the mrs ordered one. she said it was bland and very fatty. she didn\\'t like it not one bit. \\n\\nwe won\\'t be back., i keep wishing i could love this place.  i go, i\\'m disappointed.  i don\\'t go for a while, then i try again.  still disappointed.  tonight was another attempt, and another disappointment.\\n\\ngood news first.  they allow dogs on the patio and ours got first rate service.  the lovely man from the kitchen brought her water when we arrived and guests and staff alike were sweet to her.  \\n\\nthe veggie burger is good.  (i got the california version).  it\\'s just super unfortunate it\\'s buried in an oversized egg-ish bun.   if you can find it, the texture is good, the spice is right and it\\'s satisfying.  but, without the bun it\\'s not a lot of food for the price.  the french fries on my partner\\'s plate were good tonight, and whatever chicken sandwich he got was apparently flavorful.  \\n\\nthe side salad that came with my veggie burger was lackluster to say the least.  anemic might be a better description.  anemic plus slime.  a yellow leaf and about another five leaves that were the slimy green that happens when the spring mix has been sitting around too long.  i get it.  but take the slimy ones out, please.  that\\'s especially important when there are only 15 leaves in the salad!\\n\\nwhen i called attention to the salad issue, the server agreed it shouldn\\'t be and offered another salad. (i declined.)  but, the standard thing would be to offer an apology, no?  and to knock something off the check?  i don\\'t really care that they didn\\'t but given the issues with the service (slower than necessary given how empty the place was, chastised by the server for not following the rules for seating (though we had), and then not managing to bring cutlery so we had to wait more once the food was on the table for the runner to bring us some... ) this just seemed another indication that things were amiss., tonight\\'s service was the pits. waited an hour and then decided to ask for our food to-go (we were with two children).  waited an additional 15 min and had to ask for food again. when the waitress brought us our food she told us they were sold out of my husbands meal, crawfish boil, so they gave us scalloped potatoes instead.  poorly managed and understaffed., i hate to give a low rating, but this one is well deserved.  we went in for drinks and some nibbles. utter failure.  how is this place such a mess? first off, the internet was down, so they couldn\\'t accept credit cards. no problem, it\\'s comcast, it happens. next i ordered a \"seasonal\" cocktail called a london fog (i think they were left over from spring, it\\'s now fall). they didn\\'t have the ingredients so...strike two. ok i\\'ll have a vodka soda. that took at least 10 minutes to make...somehow. and used a 2l thing of seltzer because apparently the gun wasn\\'t working. fine. we then ordered the fried pickles. after 30 minutes passed...still no food. after an hour we asked if had been put in, and it had not. how?!?!?! its fried pickles???? the fryer was \"backed up\" with only 17 people in the entire place. (yes, we counted). we asked the order to be cancelled and left. after an hour and 15 minutes there we left to go to mcmenemins for actual food., i had a horrible experience at this place.  we were looking to try something new as i don\\'t eat meat and they have lots of choices. neither my husband or myself like what we got.  the waiter after taking our order was not attentive and i told him i did not like my food.  the waiter helped my husband with his food but did not come to even check if i was ok.  i would never return., just went back, for the last time. keep trying to give them a chance but there\\'s always something wrong. this time my mahi tenders and hush puppies came out overcooked, the hush puppies were burnt. the bartenders serves them like he didn\\'t notice anything wrong. this place isn\\'t exactly cheap so for these prices everything should be perfect and the staff need to be more attentive. the bartender walks around the bar and never notices your glass is empty. done done done, disappointing attempt at a meal tonight. maybe because we went on a monday, a typically slow night where they might short staff. close to an hour with no sign of appetizers. noticed nobody around us with their food, expect one table where one person sent it back. ended up paying our check and leaving before the appetizers ever came. could tell we could be there all night if we stayed. been here before on a much busier night and got our food quicker. for $10+ glasses of wine you need to have a faster kitchen on off nights like mondays. otherwise don\\'t open if you don\\'t have enough staff. our waiter was great though, felt bad he had to apologize for everything himself. nobody else ever came to support or talk to us., no stars really. one of the worst places i\\'ve been to in a long time. sunday 1pm. ordering was a hassle. they were out of ice tea, but the server said she was making more and it would 10 minutes. they were out of the sauce for general tso cauliflower. they were also out of seitan. so we ended up ordering the onion rings, veggie sausage skillet, and a mushroom po boy. \\n\\nwhile we waited for food, i used the restroom. it wasn\\'t very clean, hand soap was diluted with water! while i was on the toilet, someone tried to open the door (which was locked), then knocked - to which i replied \"there\\'s someone in here\" - and then opened the door anyway (with a key from the outside, i assume)! as the door was opening, i yelled again \"there\\'s someone in here\". thankfully the person closed the door without seeing me. terrible. \\n\\nappetizer came. onion rings were greasy, oil in the bottom of the bowl. yuk. entrees came. veggie sausage skillet looked so bleak. they gave me an oyster and shrimp po boy. called the server, who took it away. she said it was the chef\\'s fault and that he\\'d make a mushroom po boy. when that came, it was pretty much just bread with a few mushrooms, lettuce, and tomato. underwhelming, not tasty. pierogi\\'s in the veggie sausage skillet were soggy, my husband said. my ice tea arrived towards the end of my meal. \\n\\nthe check contained both the seafood and mushroom po boy. server had to run back to take the seafood po boy off. this place was a waste of money and calories., this was the worst meal i had in decades.\\n\\ni brought my family here excited about the menu.\\nthat didn\\'t last.\\nwe were given a cramped table and ordered drinks. my napkin smelled like an old dish cloth. it stank as i unfurled it but i chose to ignore it and not sour the evening with a complaint. the appetizers on the menu were mainly small portions or slightly reworked plates of entrees, so the menu variety was halved.\\nafter ordering, the first dishes arrived spread out more than five minutes, and two of them were very overcooked. the flavors were different but just not good.\\nthree of four main courses came together and the last arrived more than 15 minutes later. of the four, three were disappointing. i had the fried chicken. it was burnt and dry and i didn\\'t eat it. my wife had a veggie burger that she didn\\'t like.\\ni wish there was a way to know how bad the food was going to be before dropping $120 to find out.\\n\\ndo yourself a favor and do not eat at the grain exchange., i\\'ve given this place a few times because i live in mt airy and am vegetarian. after last night, i can finally write them off.\\n\\nfood is always overcooked and underseasoned. i got the hot memphis seitan sandwich last night and the seitan was inedible, it was so hard. and it was just hot spice with no salt or other seasoning. the roll was cold. \\n\\ni ordered an old fashioned and it was red, like kool aid. the photo doesn\\'t do justice to just how neon it was. and it tasted sweet and awful. \\n\\nto top it off, the bartender asked me to move to a two-person table from a four-person after i told him i was dining alone and that i could sit anywhere. other than two patrons at the bar, the restaurant was completely empty. \\n\\ni\\'m giving them two stars because the fries were really good.\\n\\nbut this place sucks so much., people who leave reviews tend to be negative, right? whoever noticed that is on to something because a terrible experience gave me the energy to want to write one. \\n\\ngrain exchange has had food issues in the past and was closed for a while due to health inspection failures. while we didn\\'t have any health issues (yet), i will say i can\\'t see myself going back.\\n\\nthis was my third time at grain exchange. my appetizer of fried gouda and my hot hot hot burger, which i asked to be cooked medium, were both charred to a blackened crisp, and essentially tasted identical. my wife got chicken on her sandwich instead of a burger (you have to option on the burger menu) and had no major complaints other than the gouda appetizer and slow service (see below). i got a side salad and my wife got sweet potato fries as sides to our main dishes. both were solid. \\n\\nbeers were cold when they finally got to us but it seemed the bar tender and waitress were the only two employees in the place on an i assume, uncommonly busy monday night. there was a delay between first and second drinks and ultimately between our drinks and order and order and final check. if i\\'m in mt airy, i\\'m going to earth bread or going further into chestnut hill until this place either fixes itself (doubtful based on the deli they lost up the street) or becomes something else., food has been good the few times we went, however the service has been rough. the servers are always friendly it just seems as though they never have enough help. we ended up sitting around for 30 minutes between ordering drinks and receiving them and then repeated the process with our meal. on our most recent attempt to visit we were told it would be 45 minutes even though there were several open tables and ended up leaving disappointed. if the service issues get resolved this would be a great go to spot in mount airy., horrible brunch.  the place was empty and we waited 45 minutes for the grossest brunch i\\'ve ever had. the server even dropped the check before our order came out.  no excuse and not even an attempt to make it right.  $50 for absolute slop.  never again., been back three times since my original post. the new bartenders are exceptional. too bad they\\'re on a sinking ship. \\ni think the owners are going to sabotage this place like they did the falls taproom. \\nduring my last two visits this craft beer bar was out of beer...except for four, three on draft and a couple dusty bottles. beer was warm, just like it was at falls taproom. an no ice for luke warm water. \\ngrilled octopus came out raw. so quality control is a problem because the kitchen sent it out and then the waiter took it to the table.\\nthe bartenders and staff have to keep giving out freebies becasue nothing is going right. \\nmy guess is the owners are trying to expand too much with their pizza place and terrible deli and they can\\'t pay the bills now for grain exchange., i really want to give this place 5 stars but i just cannot off of the first experience. a friend and i showed up very excited because we are vegetarians. we browsed the extensive menu and had the whole exciting meal planned out. the waiter showed up and after we ordered he basically said that everything we had ordered was not available  he then went on to read a laundry list of other things not available.  it was 8pm on a friday night. i feel like that\\'s prime time around philly and we were extremely disappointed and annoyed. we settled and still ordered some good food but not what we wanted. i ordered a beer and the keg kicked in the middle so i got half a beer for free. then none of the other beer options i wanted were available  after the meal we wanted something sweet so we asked about desert. he said would you believe me if i told you we normally have a scrumptious desert menu but we\\'re out of everything  come on. we kept positive attitudes the entire time and didn\\'t let the poor service get us down but this is garbage in my opinion. shorten your menu if you can\\'t keep up. it wasn\\'t even that busy. i might come back to try some of the items i want but you bet your ass i\\'m calling ahead first. best of luck operating a business like that., i wasn\\'t super impressed with this place. the food is very soggy and kind of weird tasting. would not recommend but it is something to eat and they were accommodating with my dietary restrictions so that was a plus. probably won\\'t be back though., i\\'ve taken many out of town guests here and met up with local friends here, as well. after consistently poor service (the most egregious of which was serving nachos with meat to my vegetarian friend who very clearly asked for and pointed to the veg \\noption), i won\\'t be returning. the drinks are expensive, but good. the food is just okay. the atmosphere is too dark, cramped, and noisy. the ongoing issues with the health department don\\'t help, either., had a not so good experience today at grain exchange. i went to the restaurant for the first time along with my son and a friend; i ordered the crab cake sandwich with sweet potato fries which were good (not the best i\\'ve had, but good nonetheless), my son had the buttermilk fried chicken and my friend had the bbq grilled chicken. as they both were eating the chicken they realized it was undercooked (fatty skin & blood beneath the dark crispy outer layer). additionally, they were out of green beans, baked beans & corn bread; we were not made aware until after we ordered. needless to say, we will not be back; although, they opted not to charge us for the two meals; there is nothing worst than realizing you were eating chicken that was undercooked. have to hope & pray no one gets sick. whoever the cook is needs to be let go asap., finally dined in for the sushi buffet on tuesdays. the first time i went it was ok service. the waiter didn\\'t fill up my water until i pointed it out. however, the second and most recent time i went, i was sorely disappointed. while the sushi buffet is still a good deal, it honestly isn\\'t worth me trekking out again. the manager has since my last visit started enforcing a no sharing rule. i inquired if we could just swap one sushi out with each other since we were both getting the sushi buffet. the waiter resolutely said no.  while he and the other waitress were polite enough when bringing our food and taking our orders, i could do without the slow service. we waited close to 30 minutes for our first set of rolls - and they chalked up the slowness due to needing to \"fry\" the tobiko. there were maybe at most 4 other tables besides us there. i could also overhear the waiter speaking in chinese that i was \"pushing\" and \"rushing\" for the food to be done. i mentioned it once - well past the 25 minute mark. sorry but frankly, there shouldn\\'t be a 30 minute wait for a single set of rolls. i would\\'ve overlooked it but it happened consistently with each set of rolls that there was a long wait. i would postulate that it\\'s a technique they use to discourage you from ordering more sushi. regardless, i\\'ve had better sushi buffets in the dc area for cheaper, better service, and better atmosphere. in a city as large as philly, i\\'m sure there are other sushi buffets to eat at. while this was my go to for take out and sushi buffets previously, i can safely say i am unlikely to return or order after my last trip. other sushi buffets i\\'ve gone to don\\'t require me to order off the menu and for me to finish each piece before getting more - and don\\'t stipulate that i can\\'t share among other people who have opted to get the sushi buffet too., i\\'m always getting menus from chinese restaurants and pizzerias, but when you have your standbys, it\\'s not easy for a new place to catch your eye. the menu for queen came this week, and i wanted to try a few things from their rather large vegetarian selection. they have the usual veggie and bean curd (a.k.a. tofu) entrees, but they also have mock chicken, beef, and duck. we actually ordered carryout the same day i read the menu - i was excited!\\n\\nthe food was okay, but i have to admit, it was disappointing. part of me wants to try another few dishes, but that part is being told to quiet down and not be so charitable. \\n\\nfirst up - moo shu vegetables. i usually love the cabbage and sweet sauce, and this had the bonus of including broccoli, baby corn, and mushrooms. but the pancakes were dry, stuck together, and inedible. the corn tasted like a can. not great.\\n\\nnext, vegetarian \"beef\" with mixed vegetables. the beef tasted like my homemade attempts at seitan, where the stuff still tastes like flour. the sauce was good, but the dish was unremarkable. \\n\\nfinally, we ordered one of the chef\\'s specialties - bean curd with general tso\\'s sauce. the silken tofu was deep fried and coated with a sticky, sugary sauce, and there were a few pieces of broccoli alongside. very disappointing - no spice, no heat, and just sugar and fat for appeal. \\n\\nthe two star rating means i\\'ve had better. my absolute favorite is wild ginger in huntingdon valley, and i also prefer china garden inn in willow grove. i was hoping for a good take out place closer to home, but this isn\\'t it., i no longer attend arcadia but would totally eat here before or after seeing a show at the keswick (or if i were in glenside for some other reason...), sushi is not good and is absolutely overpriced. there are plenty of other places to get sushi around here that are much better., the three stars only because after two visits of great service, but the one time when i went alone for a takeout order, no one greeted me. it\\'s awkward because two hosts and a waiter were just standing at the register not even saying anything to me while i waited in front of them and they only glanced at me. rude! i had to say hi first and the whole time i was standing there wondering if they were just mentally too busy for like 5-10 minutes. not a welcome feeling. the sushi chefs said nothing either. at a restaurant, you need to be verbal. you need to talk, even a simple hello is helpful to make a customer want to stay. very disappointed because i really love their beef ho fun noodles that not a lot of asian restaurants sell in glenside for a good price., ive seen better lunch proportions else where.  had a pint of wonton soup with 3 small sized wontons....no bueno, if you want decent chinese food in glenside i\\'d recommend jasmine on easton road. i\\'ve been to queen a few times in the past year, including a visit in late december 2013. i thought the food was just so-so, and the staff disappeared after our food  was served. we had to leave our table with our check in-hand and interrupt the staff\\'s dinner to get their attention, pay and get out of there. not sure that the chinese-sushi combo works for them. with a good number of decent chinese food restaurants in the area, queen is a last option., i\\'ve been ordering delivery from this place for the past year, so i finally went in to eat today. the food was great as usual. \\n\\nbut the service was horrible. i only saw the waitress when i ordered and when it was time to get the check. i loved the food, but i don\\'t think i\\'ll be going back in to eat., i order take-out from this place. normally, i don\\'t have a problem. the service is pretty quick and the person taking the order is friendly enough. i don\\'t know if they have new people working there now, but i was extremely disappointed when i called to order today. the guy on the phone was a little snippy and rude. when i wanted to redeem a coupon i had from their menu for a free fried rice, i was told that it only applied to chicken, pork and shrimp and that if i wanted the house special (which i ordered) it would be $2 extra. well...that\\'s not what the coupon says, it says \"any\". and i\\'ve ordered that before with no problems. i was then informed that they had changed their menu and the updated coupon appeared on the new menu. fine. i\\'ll just have the shrimp fried rice. that\\'ll be $1 extra. what?! you just said it was included in the free offer. no, i mean just the chicken and the pork. \\n\\nmost places would at least honor the old coupon and then say for future reference, you\\'ll need to use an updated one. this guy was just so rude about it! and then, to tell me something was free, only to take it back?! what is that? completely unacceptable business practice imo and has turned me off to this place completely. i\\'ll give it 3 stars because the food is good, but i just hate crappy customer service., one of the worse asian restaurants i have ever gotten food from.  the pad thai was a bright pink and tasted like it was left out in the sun for about three days. the beef had the texture of mush and tasted like crap., disgusting!    spare yourself the aggravation of eating at this place.  after going out of my way to get chinese food from this restaurant, where i had previously had decent food,  i could not have been more disappointed this trip.n he woman who answered the phone sounded assthough i awoke her from a coma, and had no personality whatsoever.  when i went to pick yup the food, i was alarmed to find out that there was no customers .. that speaks for itself!!  not only did they give me the wrong item, but when i called to advise them of the poor quality of the chicken, and the error in my food, ryan (the \"manager\"\" ) insisted on arguing with me.   he said if i wanted my money back, that i had to return to the restaurant.   a simple solution would have been to just make the food the way i asked for it, and not argue.   i will never return to this filthy restaurant, and you should think twice before dining there, or ordering take out.  i might suggest, they look into the quality of their meats, and that ryan take a course in restaurant management., i\\'ve been a long time yelp user and thus far i was never disappointed with their suggestions until last night when i went to queen chinese restaurant. the food was as if they took it out of the freezer and just warmed it up. my fiancee\\'s dish had a disgusting gelatinous film over it which made it inedible. she barely had 2 bites. on top of the bad food, the server didn\\'t come back once during our entire meal. after waiting 20 minutes for our check i got up and politely waited at the counter. the entire waitstaff was off on the other side of the diner talking and chatting away eating their own dinner. i understand the waitstaff needs to eat too, but that doesn\\'t mean you completely forget about your paying customers. i will not be back., walked in at 6:15 pm on a friday night (january 12th, 2018) and we were seated right away in a totally empty restaurant.  a few people came in while we were there for takeout, but no other diners besides ourselves. \\n\\nafter being seated, it took nearly ten minutes for our waitress to come over.  no greeting whatsoever, simply a question, \"are you ready to order?\"  at this byob, they have no wine glasses. we received two water glasses to drink our wine from.\\n\\nfood we ordered included beef n broccoli, chinese fried noodles, and various sushi rolls. while the sushi rolls were adequate, the other items were well below average in taste and appearance.\\n\\nunfriendly service and poor quality food are two great reasons not to return to nor recommend queen sushi. very disappointing meal., this place used to be good.  not anymore...at all. \\n\\nordered general tsos chicken and pad thai w/shrimp last night\\n\\nevery. single. piece of chicken was crunch with no meat. i also asked for it to be \"extra extra spicy\" and it seemed like they made it even less spice than a normal order. \\n\\nthe pad thai noodles were orange which my girlfriend said she has never ever seen before (she only orders pad thai)\\n\\nwe wanted to call for a refund but figured it was not even worth it well just never ever order again and recommend on here that others stay away. \\n\\nyummy yummy up the street is insanely higher in standards and nicer people to communicate with, such high hopes... people at work were hankering for sushi at lunch, which is a tall order in jenkintown. we decided to make the drive over to queen sushi in glenside. they offer chinese and japanese. that should have been a tip off, but it wasn\\'t for me. the place isn\\'t a dump or anything. it\\'s clean, well maintained and decently lit.\\n\\ni got a spicy tuna roll and a salmon crunch roll. they have lunch specials that are under $11. it just wasn\\'t that good. the texture was weird and the rice  rice wasn\\'t sticky sushi rice. no one else in the group liked the rolls they got either. my more melodramatic friend is concerned he has food poisoning. maybe they are just a better chinese place. the egg roll i got was the best thing there., these people are dirty. i am sorry for the customers that love this place. i\\'m a door dasher and every time i come in here i see something unsanitary! tonight i saw in the back kitchen the cook picking up food with his bare hands. i also saw the cashier sneeze in his hand and then hand food to another customer without them paying attention. read the constant health violations on this yelp  page and it all makes sense. if you eat here after this review, god be with you!, worst experience with delivery and service i\\'ve ever had. i ordered my food at 6:00 pm and we live 10 minutes away. it says to give them 45 minutes for delivery, so we did. and then, an hour and 15 minutes later, we decided to give them a call. she says our driver is on his way. wait another 25 minutes, and he rolls up. we waited for an hour and 40 minutes for our food to be delivered. i express my discontent, he smiles, rips the receipt i signed from my hand, and drove off. \\n\\nokay, i can forgive this, right? not quite. \\n\\nour fried wontons? cold. wonton soup? container wasn\\'t closed all the way and spilled all over my food, causing one bag to rip open and spill crunchy noodles everywhere. the fried rice container was soaked, the paper bag holding the contents fell apart, and there was no fortune cookies. \\n\\nthis isn\\'t my first time ordering from them, i usually love them. today, i don\\'t know if i can order from them again.\\n\\nnow, for the positives i do have. when eating in, if it\\'s not crowded, you can count on good sushi. the restaurant is clean. the prices are definitely reasonable, they offer a deal for us college students at arcadia on $30 or more, and they do often get your food to you quickly., not good, also expensive. was like being in bizarro world where all foods were being made with the wrong ingredients. pad thai had cabbage in it. udon was very salty. chicken didn\\'t come out until after everyone had eaten. pricing was nonsensical and also to be frank the food should have been free as it probably belonged in the garbage. however, the avocado rolls and dumplings were out of this world amazing., i ordered over the phone and went to pick it up and realized that the men making the sushi weren\\'t wearing masks. ontop of that, my order is completely wrong., good portion of food. but sent me the item i did not order and insisted that i ordered it wrong. here you can see.. boneless. i hate bone in with a passion. gentlemen on the phone, fix your app descriptions., only signed up for yelp to share the absolutely terrible experience i had here - i am not one to knock people down but i have never been treated so poorly before and even tried to speak to them in person then call to share my experience and instead i was treated even worse. \\n\\nso here goes...\\n\\nmy husband, daughter, and i came here for dinner this evening and were the only people in the restaurant. first time, and we were given attitude from the very start as the waitress took our order. turns out the waitress was also the manager as well as the owner. you would think that the owner of a restaurant would want customers to have a positive experience and have basic customer service skills. the food was okay but she never came to check on us and forgot my daughter\\'s meal altogether. all the staff was in the back, while we were waiting for someone to come out so we could let them know they forgot our daughter\\'s food and we were waiting on the check. we got the sushi chef\\'s attention who was sitting crouched behind the sushi bar on his phone. (which i can imagine is some sort of health code violation). finally, he got the waitress/manager/owner and i explained to her we have never had such terrible service especially being as we were the only people in the restaurant. she had no concern whatsoever, nor was she in the least bit apologetic. i noticed this and said that it didn\\'t seem as though she cared. her response was \"yeah i don\\'t have time to care\". i was taken aback by the blatant lack of concern. i called later to speak with a manager to share the experience i had in case it was not a typical thing. i got the same person on the phone who shared that she was the manager as well as the owner. she continued with her non-giving-a-s#it and was very disrespectful so here i am on yelp trying to ease my own what-the-fu#k-just-happened. oh also we ordered my daughter pizza from silver moon pizza in roslyn. she loved it, no complaints there., we went for lunch and ordered and waited and waited. there was only one other table occupied. we never got the soup we ordered, never got my japanese salad. never got the complimentary noodles. never got our entrees and my sushi had sat on the counter for at least 15 minutes and when we left after waiting for 45 minutes, the sushi was still sitting on the counter. i can\\'t review the food because we never had any, but i can tell you the service stinks!, i got take-out and it was expensive and the food was horrible.  i called to get my money back. i had to throw it away.  i will never order from here again., ribeye was thin and chewy. i tried it again a few months later. i spit it out. literally. onto my plate. easily worst i\\'ve ever had., my fiancée and i went to lunch on mlk jr day around 1pm.  it wasn\\'t busy so we expected the service to be excellent and to my surprise it wasn\\'t.  the hostess was less than excited to greet us with barely a smile and such a low voice we could hardly understand her.  after we sat, it took our server about 10 minutes to greet us, although he was apologetic and cheery.  it then took another 6-7 mins to bring our drinks, one beer and water.  the good was far below par.  my jalepeno shooters were luke warm at best.  my half pound burger was average and her special sirloin lacked any seasoning.  all i can say is that i\\'m glad we had a gift card from christmas we used because i would\\'ve asked to speak to a manager...which i didn\\'t notice one at all patrolling the floor.  maybe in the future we will try again but most likely at a different location!!, the food is incredibly salty to the point of tasting bitter- all of it from appetizer to the main course and french fries.   we were barely able to eat  half of our food. we just paid the bill and left. the waitress didn\\'t seem to care much., i have frequented longhorn\\'s over the past few years.  the last 3 times my wife and i were there, one of us got a very poor cut of meat.  we ordered the renegade sirloin each time (because it was our favorite). we are extremely disappointed and since there are so many other choices, doubt we will eat there in the future., this place sucks!  it was the worst meal i have ever had. would have been better off going to mcdonalds across the street., used to frequent the place regularly.  however, something has changed.  food has gone down hill and bar service is non-existent and unattentive.  i\\'ll give it a couple of months to straighten out...seems like new management is needed or needs time to fix it., i\\'m not normally one to write a bad review, but this was just a painful experience.\\n\\nwe were seen to, and seated quickly, which was good. but they attempted to seat us at a booth that was still dirty with dropped food and a napkin still under the table, and crumbs still on the seats.\\n\\nwe arrived at 7 p.m., and didn\\'t actually see our server until 7:15. by then my wife had had to go and get a high chair for our son on her own, as the other servers carefully didn\\'t meet our eyes while we were struggling with him.\\n\\nit took another 15 minutes to receive our appetizer, which was missing sauce, and an anemic salad. the table bread itself never appeared, nor did half of our drink order.\\n\\nby the time 8 o\\'clock came we were looking around for our absent waitress in order to cancel our dinner order so that we could just go. we were hoping to find something fast and edible at say mcdonalds.\\n\\nthat was when a busboy brought out our food and dropped it on the tables in front of us and left quickly without another word. the steak one of us had ordered was way past medium rare and well into well done. the steak salad the other of us ordered was cold with congealed dressing as was the meat on top.   \\n\\non the upside, when a manager finally came over to find out why we were trying so hard to flag our waitress over so that we could leave without eating, he did take one of the two dishes off the bill.\\n\\non the downside, as we were leaving the waitress managed to insinuate that it was our own fault for not having told her that we were in a hurry.\\n\\n\\nbecause apparently it\\'s your own fault if you don\\'t tell the waitress you\\'re in a hurry when you want to spend less than an hour and a half here for a disappointing meal that none of you ate., waited 10 min at the bar for someone to even acknowledge me. there were exactly 2 other people at the bar and restaurant was not busy. one bartender was talking to an employee at one end of the bar, another was chatting with the other 2 people at the bar. unacceptable. there is literally no good option for dinner in this area so this place could do really well. have to beef up your service. immediately!, inattentive staff. i sat down and waited 20 min before anyone came up. tried making eye contact with 3 people behind the bar, i sat at the bar thinking it would be faster, and they all ignored me. when i arrived there were dirty plates and an empty drink glass on my right and my left and they stayed there for 35 min until i asked if they could please remove them as they were attracting flying insects. when i did finally get service i was asked what i wanted to drink and they brought it to me then proceeded to tell me to give them a min and they would be back to take my order. 15 minutes later they came back, counter still dirty as they never cleaned them from the prior guests, i simply asked for my check to pay for my beer then left to go eat somewhere else. avoid at all costs if you like a clean and friendly environment., fastest thing that came was the check! this review is about the service only not the food.\\ni come here every few months because i love their french onion soup and just want it. the last few times i have come here the service was alright, tonight it just sucked. we went at around 9 pm and only about 5 tables where seated and a lot of servers standing around. the waitress we had was miserable and acted like she had no interest in being there or waiting on us. it took forever for her to tell us she would be with us in a minute. when she came she had an attitude. silverware came out dirty and i couldn\\'t find her anywhere to get a new spoon. i tried to flag down the manager but he just looked the other direction and ignored me, and yes he saw me. the rest of the meal came and as always the saving grace of this evening was the food. when we finished we where not sitting there waiting and looking around to find her because she came right out with the check and took it as soon as we put money in it. if it wasn\\'t for the cook staff and the food i wouldn\\'t come because the service sucks., well, this restaurant seems to be going downhill. we go here alot, and recently noticed a decline in quality and service . today, we waited an hour as they forgot to put our order in. after saying something and having the food come, i wasn\\'t even hungry for my fatty steak and cold mashed potatoes. the waitress flat-out lied to us, telling us the kitchen was backed up and there was a problem with the temperature of the meat. although the manager kindly came over and apologized for the waitress forgetting to put our order in, but apologies can only do so much. it is becoming hard to come to this restaurant anymore because there is always a problem. i don\\'t recommend this restaurant as much as i used to., came on a friday night around 6:30 when it was snowing. place was half empty but appeared to have a full wait staff. a waitress did not come over for 10 minutes. we promptly ordered our drinks and food. salads for dinner came out about five minutes later. still no drinks. waitress went and checked again and came back with drinks a few moments later and one water (even though two of us). \\n\\nwhen my steak came it was ridiculously fatty. so much so i did not eat it. while i did not expect great considering it was only a $22 steak, i did expect to see a better cut of meat. the waitress did offer to take it off bill which was nice. the salmon dish my gf got was average, not bad nor that good. \\n\\nall in all poor food and extremely slow service. would not recommend based on this visit., worst longhorn experience ever. staff were just hanging around. no one cleared dirty tables next to us for full 90 min we were there. took forever to get our check - meanwhile they were not busy - just laughing and standing around. never again!, i had the ny strip with rice which was good. the salad and bread are also good.the first margarita i had was delicious it even came with candy rock in it but the second one was way too sweet. the chocolate cake dessert is huge. i could have fed the whole table with it. \\ni would have rated this place more if it wasn\\'t for the bad service. the hostesses were great though.they sat us down at a timely matter (we did call ahead though) and even accommodated when i had to change the number of my party. \\nhowever, the waitress was terrible. she was nice and all but just terrible at service. she was in a hurry. so much in a hurry that i tried to order an appetizer twice and she left so i ended up not ordering it. every time we ordered drinks she either forgot or we had to wait forever for them. after appetizers and salads we sat there for what seemed like an hour for our food.  when i finally got my food the plate was a mess! it looked like they plopped it on the plate and sent it out. there was grease everywhere. the rice was all over the place. we were a party of 7 which is really not that big and it definitely doesn\\'t excuse the bad service especially since my check alone was $150. i don\\'t know what is up with this place but i will eat at longhorn again just not at this one!, we have been going here since they opened.  this meal tonight was the pits.  service was great, food was sub par.  fries were limp and undercooked.  chicken tenders were like they were frozen and thawed in the dryer.  so tough., horrible service.  manager not at all helpful. first we did a call ahead for a party of 9 at 5:00. at 5:45 they attempted to seat us at a table fitting only six. we refused it of course. the hostess then pointed to a table which she said would be empty in about 15 min. around 20 min later the table was empty and cleared so we sat down. we were tired of standing!!! we were then told we had to move to another table. i said we\\'re seated now and we\\'re staying here. no menus, no service for another 15 min. i went to the manager and she had the unmitigated gaul to tell me we sat at the wrong table!!  manager needs to be schooled on customer service., waitress rude.   interrupted during each order... asked twice to bring napkins.  threw her hands in the air at me when i told her i was not ready for boxes and we were still eating.... it was lunch... not crowded... her shift was over and she needed to leave.  she needs more training on niceness. lost a customer...., big disappointment!  the food is very good, which is why i took my parents here to celebrate father\\'s day last night.  arrived at 6:00 pm, waited 40 minutes to be seated, ordered right away, then it took over 1 hour and 10 minutes to be served!  the waitress said she did not forget our order but something must have happened to it in the kitchen.  the manager brought the food out at almost 8:00 pm but did not apologize or explain.  he didn\\'t think i had a right to be upset.  it\\'s too late to eat a heavy meal at 8:00 pm so we asked for boxes to eat our meals at home tonight.  if the manager had apologized for the long wait, it would have made a big difference in our experience and my review!!!, what can i say.... you come here for a good hot meal and what you get is a plate full of excuses and cold food!!! then to ask for a manager and have to wait another 15 minutes! to say i\\'m pissed is a complete understatement! if this meal isn\\'t 100% free i will never step foot back into this restaurant! if you don\\'t get a seasoned waiter or waitress your screwed! this isn\\'t my first bad experience here but i guarantee you it will be my last! long horn used to be a great place with hot quality food now it\\'s like one step above over priced fast food. save yourself the trip and good somewhere better., i go here with my family on weeknights.  it\\'s not crowded and we\\'re usually starving.  i always order the salmon with a sweet potato and ceasar salad.   you can tell that it\\'s chain restaurant food, but it\\'s not horrible.  the servers are funny.  the last time we went, it was a big giant snowstorm and they stayed open.  the decor inside this place is horrible., this place has awful service. we ordered take out and got an entirely incorrect order. i got home and realized this.  no one bothered to call from the restaurant.  when i called them, they immediately knew what happened. we had to go pick up our correct order.  we ordered entrees that came with salads and sides. they didn\\'t include those in the corrected order.  when we picked it up the manager had a huge attitude with us.  the food is typical chain food and sloppily thrown together.  i complained to corporate and they offered a gift card that i did not take.  they were at least apologetic and that\\'s the only reason for one star., all of the dishes and plates were dirty. even heard people at nearby tables complaining. the cooks managed to cook none of our steaks the way we asked. the waitress couldn\\'t even be bothered to refill waters the entire time we were there. the food is priced ~1/3 higher than it should be. definitely will not be going here again; darden restaurants is ruining the chains they manage., was seated at a table in long need a a real cleaning, not one of those 2 second wipes by a server or hostess with a overused, underwashed rag looking to turn over the table asap..something nasty was making my sleeve stick to the top. walls also has some unknown garbage on them. waitress brought bread after taking our drink order. both plates had food remnants on them \\nwe left.\\ni should have taken the hint from the dirty windows and doors\\nwhen a restaurant doesn\\'t care about the dining area, you probably don\\'t want to know what\\'s going on in the back, let alone expect a meal to come out that\\'s not likely been exposed to some e-coli or salmonella, we were planning on having a birthday dinner at 6:30 for 10-11 people.  we called around noon inquiring about the restaurant\\'a ability to accommodate.  the restaurant told us that while they do not accept reservations, if we call in at around 5:30, they should be able to accommodate.  we called at 5:40 and the restaurant told us that it would be another 40 minutes from when we arrive to seat us.  we made arrangements for everyone to meet there.  when we arrived at 6:15, they told us we had to wait 90 minutes.  had they told us when we called at noon that they could not readily accommodate us, we would not have made plans to meet there.  they even had opportunity when we called at 5:30 to tell us that we would have to wait that long.  we do not appreciate being jerked around like that., i don\\'t actually have an issue with the food but our last two experiences have been concerning.  we brought a $400 gift card a few months ago to pay and when the waiter ran it said it only had $100 on it which was confusing but we accepted and thought we had made a mistake. then last night we went with a $100 gift card but waitress said it had only $38.77.  husband had run to car so when he came back i told him and we asked they get the card back and check since he had called to confirm the amount before we went. sure enough it had $100. it took forever to get the credit back etc. and to credit our credit card. no manager ever came to the table and nothing was offered for our inconvenience. we will not return and wonder about integrity since we have had two issues. call and verify the amount is what we have learned., place smelled horrible, like wet carpet or something. the place needs some serious ventilation. we used to love longhorn and every time we went to a restaurant my husband would say, longhorn was better but today the food was very unappetizing. we couldn\\'t wait to finish the meal to leave and smell some fresh air., i\\'m writing this as we wait for our salads...not even our meals after 30 minutes with 2 other tables seated. not cool. warm bread couldn\\'t even warm this review. and now it\\'s 15 minutes after the salads and no entree. 45 minutes for a table of 4. \\nnow for the kicker...my husband\\'s 8oz steak that was ordered well done came out a very red and runny medium rare. another 10 minutes...the manager brought the plate back to the table, waited for him to check and explained how hot the oven was to make sure it was well. a meal comp would have helped...$48 for a painful hour and 15 minutes dining experience., we went for lunch.  server asked when i wanted my salad and then forgot to bring it out.  steak was placed on a large empty plate without any garnishes.  server seemed rather flighty and disorganized., i understand covid restrictions but this restaurant wasn\\'t even close to a 3rd full and yet it took 45 minutes to be seated and the kicker was that two parties came in after us and weren\\'t on the list and yet seated before us. and on top of that they texted us that the table was \"ready\". nope! wasn\\'t ready and we waited another ten minutes to be seated. terrible service here. beyond that, the table top was sticky, the floors were dirty, and the bathrooms were a complete disaster and gross., the waiters pretend to have southern accents.\\n\\nmy steak was not cooked. i got sick.\\n\\nthe manager told me to call him if anything else \"pops up.\" usually bad food only needs to \"pop up\" once for you to know its bad.\\n\\ncorporate ignored my e-mail about the bad food and terrible customer service.\\n\\ndon\\'t eat here., it pains me to write this, but i fear i must...\\n\\ni used to really enjoy p&k as a lively neighborhood spot with elevated pub food. but yesterday in the early evening, the place was overrun with drunken frat boys dropping f-bombs at top volume and shouting about their exploits as rapists. after multiple parties complained, asked to be moved, or left altogether, what did the management do? nothing! just kept serving them more beer.\\n\\nit\\'s hard to justify $25-$30 dishes when the atmosphere is that of no-class dive bar. and skip the octopus. it\\'s overcooked and rubbery.\\n\\nto be fair, the oysters were excellent; hence the second star., i put off trying p & k because of the $12 price tag on the burger, even though it\\'s been recommended.  yesterday i decided i\\'d try it out for drinks.  the mark up is almost as bad for drinks.  however the real turn off was the service.  the hostesses and waitresses were all aloof and unengaged.  hypothesis 1- management sought to hire snooty staff.  hypothesis 2- they are made to dress them in quite constraining clothes and they can hardly breathe enough to talk to customers.  who knows?, this anecdote well summarizes my experience.  a friend and i had lunch here.  when the waiter came over to the table midway through our meal and asked perfunctorily \"how\\'s everything?\" both of us replied, \"frankly, everything is very salty!\"  \"a lot of people have told me that,\" our waiter replied.  \"well,\" i said, \"did you ever manage to go back to the kitchen and tell them?!\", this is more like a 2.5 star review. my recent experience was pretty \"meh\"...\\n\\ni used to love this place when i lived down the street. i hadn\\'t been in for a long time, and stopped in for a quick bite and glass of wine around happy hour time. i ordered a glass of wine, which was like $10. not having a happy hour wine is really annoying, although they do offer a $20 bottle. adding some glasses of wine to the happy hour menu would be cool. \\n\\ni ordered the pretzel with cheese. the pretzel was hard as a rock. so hard, in fact, that i couldn\\'t cut it with a steak knife. i only ate about half because i was starving (it was 5pm and i hadn\\'t eaten all day). strangely enough, i feel like more than one employee saw me struggling to cut the damn pretzel, and no one asked me if everything was ok. strange. i could have broken a window with that pretzel! or a tooth!\\n\\neither way, it was a disappointing visit to a place i once loved., came here for brunch with some friends and was underwhelmed. i got the egg white omelet and my friends got the cheddar and apple omelets. they were both pretty bland. the jam with the toast was the highlight of the meal. if you are getting a bloody go for the wrangler. the service was pretty slow and not super friendly. i usually love this place, but won\\'t be coming back for brunch., the more and more i go to gastropubs, the less and less impressed i am by them. i don\\'t know if the schtick is just getting old, or if people are doing a worse job, or what, but c\\'mon people, entertain me!!!\\n\\npub and kitchen strikes me as a fairly run of the mill entry into the gastropub arena. very nice interior rehab job? check. pretty awesome selection of beers? check. couple fancy, gourmet-ish items on the menu? check. yawn. the thing missing was something to separate this place from the crowd. why would i go here instead of any other place just like this? jonny brendas has whiskey donuts. the tap room has tacos of the day. the royal has one of the better burgers around, not to mention innovative uses of pork that surprise me every time (mmmm, pulled-pork nachos with beer cheese sauce ... i digress.) this place had ... 18 dollar fish and chips. 18 bucks??? seriously? for fish and chips? maybe you should\\'ve saved some money on the fancy interior so you could serve some food for a reasonable price. listen up pub and kitchen (and you too, devils den!): if i wanna spend 40 dollars on dinner, i\\'m not going to a gastropub, not when there are better dinners to be had for $40 (pick your byob) or much cheaper gastropubs with the same food! i don\\'t get the 20 dollar entree movement in these places, it really makes no sense.\\n\\none other irk: our waiter was nice, but he had to have come to our table like 45 times during the course of the meal. body language my friend, it will tell you all you need to know, like when we are done with our menus (see: putting down menu), when i need another drink (see: drink close to or completely empty). this ain\\'t rocket science homey. (update: as i read through all the other reviews, bad service is a recurring theme.)\\n\\nif you live near pub and kitchen, or are in the area, hit it up, it\\'ll be a fine dinner. but i don\\'t think it\\'s worth traveling very far at all to go to this place., had dinner here on a gorgeous night -- we had to take advantage of the weather and sit outside. we were told it would be a 45 minute wait for a table, so we had a few drinks at the bar. $7 cocktails? this new yorker needs to travel -- who am i kidding? -- anywhere to get her affordable liquor fix! i ordered the mint julep but really didn\\'t like it... the bartender swapped it out for the strawberry sangria for free! spreading the love in philly :) the sangria was much tastier... i had been craving mussels all day and so was thrilled to see them on the dinner menu. big mistake - these mussels were in a hefeweizen broth. the flavor was awful. the color of the broth was murky and make me frightened to dip my bread. and once i mustered up the courage, it didn\\'t even taste good! soooo very disappointing meal. my friends were perfectly satisfied with their own selections, so i\\'m just going to chalk it up to poor selection on my part. but if the word \"pub\" is in the name of your restaurant, shouldn\\'t you do a good job with mussels? three stars for the cheap and tasty alcohol :), i\\'ve never seen a ruder, more miserable passive-aggressive person operating an establishment in any service industry. anyone can get a good review or two by spending money with the local shiny-papered lifestyle magazines. what matters is when this wretched man has one of his mood swings and nothing suits him for the rest of the night. \\n\\nand that\\'s why i won\\'t ever go to this place again after giving it several chances. not to mention the restrooms belong at a gathering of the juggalos. condoms unflushed in a toilet, spit (i hope ) all over the mirror, urine all over the floor, pubic hairs in the sinks, and the spray they use to cover it up stinks as bad as the stale urine.\\n\\ni went here with my significant other several times over the past few years and every time it\\'s the same thing with this guy. just a real awkward feeling, he explodes on someone for nothing at all. one time he thought my s.o. and i were responsible for bringing smoke into the bar when we just walked in the door. his bar back was on the steps smoking a cigarette, what were we supposed to do? wait for him to finish ? we are the customers. a competent leader would tell the employee not to smoke at the customer entrance and wouldn\\'t take out his anger on an innocent paying customer.\\n\\npoor form, he drags the mood down when he talks about employees and customers behind their back to other customers. nobody wants to be involved in his problems. that\\'s what this man can\\'t understand. customers just want food and/or drink. he\\'s not that important. people choose to go elsewhere. i don\\'t want him talking to me about his bartender not doing enough work and causing him to spend the whole evening behind the bar helping out. i don\\'t care. i just want the proper environment for enjoying food and drinks. he isn\\'t a part of that, it sickens me to eat near the man.\\n\\nhe has issues. i don\\'t want him serving or preparing my food or drinks. i just don\\'t trust him. there are so many better choices in that neighborhood., i went again this past thursday after dinner at amis...pnk is usually my favorite place but i was so turned off last night it might be awhile til i head back. \\nthree of us were all standing at the bar watching the tv (all star game) and the bartender just up and turned it to some random channel!!! everyone i was with thought it had to of been a mistake and there was no way that she didn\\'t see us watching!  we ended up not saying anything but someone else must have because within 2 minutes she turned it back....she is the only rude bartender in the whole place..., doesn\\'t live up to its potential. love the atmosphere and bar but i have never enjoyed a meal there (been there at least 10 times due to it being nearby and friends wanting to go).  most recently, my food was gross and misrepresented on the menu and the server (who seemed really nice but also really busy trying to get out of there for the night) did not ask to box up my virtually uneaten plate or ask if something was wrong., i\\'ve been bummed on p&k\\'s food ever since spring 2009 when they took the fish and chips off the menu (and believe me, i kept trying \\'til recently. goodbye, churchill burger, too :(( )\\ni want to continue to like the bar...but going any time past 7:30 pm, it\\'s been pure loud chaos in there.\\nto end on a positive, though, i\\'ll keep stopping by every so often for their oyster special. that is, \\'til they take that away, too., another trendy place with little more  to offer than the place to be seen.\\nwe did not try the bar which was too noisy and too crowded. \\nwe ate outside and i am reviewing only the restaurant.\\nwe ordered the burger but the waitress said we should order appetizer because the wait was 30 minutes... thirty minutes for a burger??? well the burger are all cooked to order and many people are ordering it said the waitress. we were kind of expecting that the food would be cooked a la minute, we were not in a fast food joint.\\n\\n55 minutes later, our food arrived. one hour to cook two rare hamburger? \\nthe burgers were cooked as ordered, good size but a little greasy. nothing special, just another burger produced by an understaffed kitchen which was not able to produce the food on time.\\nhowever, there was no apology for the delay and when the bill came, it was $18 for the burger. mine was $19.50 because i ordered fries.\\nlook at the site from pub and kitchen... they do not give the price of their burger... wonder why?\\ndo the math and you will spend over $70 for 2 burgers and 2 drinks including tax and tips. in my opinion it is not worth it., i live in the neighborhood and love the location and the vibe of the place. but the food was not good. while they seemed fresh the fried things were greasy, the salad was salty and the wings were beyond salty and just not good. so disappointed., went here on recommendation to try the gnudi and i may not be taking recommendations from that person again. they seemed to be pan seared, smothered in butter and then served in a greasy oily mess. gross. \\nalso, trying to get my bartenders attention from him flirting with the female bartender  made my experience even worse. when he finally would come over he acted annoyed that i was breaking up his little moment., we had lunch here today and i wasn\\'t impressed at all.  the service sucked.  we were about to leave when the waiter finally came over.  i was again about to leave when the food finally showed up.  the food was fine, but my burger wasn\\'t worth the $18.  there were only 4 tables including us and a few people at the bar.  when we were finished the waiter kept looking over at us, but never came over.  i finally had to get up and go ask him for the check.  wtf?, this place is pretty expensive.  i do not mind expensive.  i frequent expensive places.  i like quality too.    this place is not quality.  i\\'ve been here a couple times before writing a review because too many people whose opinions said great things about it.  fuck that noise.  \\n\\ni\\'ve found cocktails to be inconsistent each time i was there.        the bartenders do not know how to make a good drink more complicated than 1 mixer and 1 liquor.  \\n\\ni\\'m not a fan of the starters either.  i\\'ve never had a full meal here based on the starters.  first off, they\\'re all pretty rich and decadent.  sounds good, yeah? every time i tried they\\'ve been over salted and if it\\'s hot, a bit burned. \\n\\nit\\'s just another place for people in the neighborhood to show people how awesome they are.    the older douche crowd., awful service will not return to pub & kitchen.  after we were seated outside the server berated us when we ordered two salads and fries for four people that \"outside tables are only for dinner.\"  it was 10 pm and the hostess had said sitting outside was fine -  i told the server that we had discussed it with the hostess, at which point the server rolled her eyes and said she would have to go check with the hostess.  after five awkward minutes of feeling like scolded children, the server came back and said that she would let us sit there (was she doing us a favor?) but if someone wanted the table to eat, then she would move us.  i said, \"even though two of the four of us are eating?\" and she said, very condescendingly, \"sweetheart, you\\'re just eating salads.\"  i was completely offended and flabbergasted - it was a really hostile tone from our server for no apparent reason - there were no parties waiting for tables, it was 10 pm, and we actually had ordered food.  we joked that we should have engaged in a philosophical argument about what dinner constituted.\\n\\nneedless to say that we were feeling pretty uncomfortable and so we left.  when we went to let the server know as a courtesy so she wouldn\\'t fill our order, she basically begged us to stay, compounding the awkwardness.\\n\\npub & kitchen is in my neighborhood and it has been one of my favorite spots because of the delicious food and beer.  i suggested that my boyfriend and i go on a double date last night around 10 pm to grab a drink and a snack.  it was beautiful out so we asked to sit outside - and that\\'s where the trouble started.\\n\\ni won\\'t be returning and i am pretty blown away by our experience., because it\\'s so darn close, my husband and i have been here several times and i must say, we\\'ve been progressively more disappointed, which is why i\\'m writing this review. unless you plan on dining at p&k in the 5:00 hour, it\\'s very crowded and loud, to the point where we have to shout to hear each other across the table. so much for intimate conversation! another thing we have noticed is that we are treated differently if one (or both) of us orders an alcoholic beverage. we\\'re not big drinkers and when we choose not to have beer or wine with our meal, we shouldn\\'t feel pressured to do so in the hopes that we\\'ll receive better service. a classic example: the last time we were there, our waitress was visibly disappointed that we weren\\'t ordering drinks and told us that the kitchen was backed up about 30 minutes and that it would probably take a while for us to get our food. we waited for a little while, and the waitress came back once or twice to see if we wanted anything from the bar, until my husband finally caved and ordered a beer. wouldn\\'t you know it - the waitress\\'s attitude changed and our food came out about a minute later. how convenient. finally, a note about the food. we\\'ve been with p&k through a few menu changes now and the latest menu revision is very disappointing. they got rid of our favorite items on the menu - the bbq pulled pork sandwich and the parliament burger. the menu offers a roasted pork sandwich, which is supposed to be a spin-off of the kind you\\'d get at dinic\\'s in reading terminal, but it fails. the only burger choice is now the $18 burger (churchill, i think?), probably due to the fact that when they had 2 burger choices, i\\'m sure more people ordered the $14 option. clever. speaking of the new pork sandwich and burger, just a heads-up: they will ask you if you want a salad or fries, even though they charge you extra for the fries, a fact that they fail to disclose when you think you actually have an equal choice. i think the bottom line for us is that we don\\'t really have a reason to come back here for a while, between the disappointing menu and the tacit pressure to order alcohol., if you are going to screw me in a dark room in public at least take my pants off first so i can have fun and if your charge me $18 for a burger and $8 for a sippy cup of beer i want my toes to curl... not the case. i am disappointed i use to like this place and it was never this expensive or lacking in quality  just stopped in for a quick bite to eat and pretty much had to remortgage the house so i didn\\'t have to wash dishes to cover my tab and for what? \\nlook i don\\'t mind paying for quality, but this just wasn\\'t the case. get over yourself pubs kitchen get over it !, third times a ... well, i wanted it to be a charm, but it was another dud.  i really wanted to like pub and kitchen since i live two blocks away and thought that something a little more trendy would be a nice addition to the graduate hospital neighborhood.  i\\'ve been there three times now, and had dinner and drinks each time.  the food has ranged from barely edible to decent, but certainly nothing impressive.  i could put up with okay food if the atmosphere was welcoming and i still saw the value, but with the nose-in-the-air attitude and prices equivalent to some of the nicer rittenhouse restaurants, i don\\'t see any reason to return to pub and kitchen., went there one time drunk off my ass with some friends. hipster paradise. $5 bottled beer. i asked the bartender if the place was called \"rabbit pig\" because the pretenious prick owners thought it would be cool to not have a name anywhere on the building. the bartender then asked us to leave. place sucks., i am so sad to write that i really had a negative experience at pub and kitchen.  i arrived at this restaurant with a medium size group of friends (6 of us) for a sendoff dinner for a couple moving to arizona.  the hostess had trouble accommodating us and acted slightly put out.  it was my first time to the restaurant since it was updated and revamped and became pub and kitchen.  upon looking at the menu i realized there were not many vegetarian options.  i asked our waiter if the kitchen could alter an entree and make it veg friendly for me....and he snidely suggest i try the side of brussel sprouts.  i explained i was more hungry then for just a small side plate and he simple repeated himself, \"your best bet are the brussel sprouts.\"  such a bummer.  i used to frequent this place when it was chaucer\\'s.  just walking in the door made me feel nostalgic.  i really wanted to enjoy my dinner there.  i would give pub and kitchen a second chance cause i am a forgiving lady, but i do hope they would be slightly more accommodating to someone with dietary restrictions.  i have lots of friends who love this restaurant and i would like to join them for dinner sometime!, i don\\'t love it here. the food is mediocre at best. the menu is tiny and there is only one burger, and it\\'s not a regular lettuce/tomato/ cheese burger. the burger i got today, off the special fourth of july menu -- so i realize it\\'s a little different than the normal menu, but why further limit your burger selection on the fourth? the regular menu didn\\'t include *any* burgers -- was a single, 3 oz patty. i asked if it could be cooked medium and was told that it would arrive medium to medium well, as it was too small to cook to  preference. medium well?? but it\\'s $15 and i would really prefer medium. i didn\\'t say that bc the server seemed mad that i would ask for a specific temperature. so i asked if i could have fries instead of the sides that were included (potato salad, corn cob, and chips) and was told \\'no\\', but i could order a side of fries in addition to the sides that i didn\\'t want. so, not easy to order burger and fries on the fourth. \\n\\nthe burger that arrived, tiny as indicated, was covered in pickles and onions so that you could barely taste the meat and was really salty. my husband got the pork sandwich and it was a mess, covered in the sauce that comes with it. it fell apart immediately and was not well seasoned. the fries he got weren\\'t seasoned either. \\n\\ni\\'ve eaten here before and those experiences were better, but i haven\\'t had a good experience yet. i thought that p&k was supposed to be so amazing, with really good burgers ( i really love burgers!!! ) but how can that be true when only one is on the menu??? and it doesn\\'t even come with a tomato, i think that\\'s so weird. \\n\\nit is a beautiful restaurant and might be ok for drinks only, especially with big open windows and outside seating. the beer menu looked accommodating and there were more than a couple wines by the glass, but the lackluster, messy food, combined with servers who seemed annoyed from the moment you walk in, made me give it two stars. \\n\\nhopefully i\\'ve just had random bad experiences, but it will be awhile before i go back., went back tonight hoping for a better time, this time we ate. \\n\\nmeh. i really wanted to like this place, i\\'m now amazed the locals keep coming here, they must truly be desperate. \\n\\nmenu is overpriced for the mediocre quality. it offers a non-inspiring small selection. 5 entrees? nothing healthy to eat on the menu at all. we ordered the mussels. they are bad. no really, i dare you to eat them tonight.. sauce is ok at best, and literally the mussels are spoiled. 1 burger selection?\\n\\nthis place gets 1 star for nice atmosphere, another for decent beers...... \\nbtw, victory wheat.. yeah that should be a 16oz pour for $6.. it doesn\\'t belong in a 12oz glass for $6. terrible., reside near by so come here out of convenience. was hoping to make it my neighborhood spot but i\\'d recommend walking a few blocks away for better options. in addition, the food is not consistent at all and it is way overpriced because they have no real competition. don\\'t expect much and you might not be disappointed. simply blah...service doesn\\'t meet the price., ok, so i want to give this place a better review. i live right down the street and nothing makes me more excited than a brand new place in walking distance. i have visited the place 3 times and all three times i had, not just bad, but terrible service. the one guy waiter has such a bad attitude and no sense of humor at all. the hostesses think they are paris hilton, piss poor attitudes and such. two out of the three times our food came out wrong and the third time we had to argue with the waiter to remove the wings from the bill (they never came to the table). once we were over charged for wine that we did not order. additionally, the year on the wine menu did not match the year on the bottle that arrived at our table. any wine lover will know that the difference in the year will change the price of the wine entirely. the servers at pub and kitchen do not seem to understand the little things that make a quality customer service experience, they seem to not care at all. do not even think of asking for a substitution...the first server we had at this place looked like a deer in headlights when we asked for caramelized onions on the burger (instead of the pickled onions), she told us that the chef would \"freak\" if she asked him that. \\n\\nthe final nail in the coffin for me was on election day. the restaurant has a few very nice flat screen tv\\'s and i asked the server if he could turn on the tv at the bar so i could see the poll results as they came in. he said he would check and came back and said \"no\". i said, \"do the tv\\'s not work?\" he said, yes, they work but wee are not turning them on tonight. i was kinda shocked that on election night the tvs were blank but they are on at all other times during the week. \\n\\nso, even though i think the food is pretty good, i am over the attitude at this place. i would rather just walk to 10 stone or take a few more steps and head into rittenhouse. i hope the owner reviews these responses and makes some positive changes to the customer service, i would love to see it turn around so i can add them back to my good list., fine as a pub, bad as a kitchen. simply put, the food was not good. my fish was overcooked, bland, and soggy. the green sauce was excessively oily. the dessert pudding tasted fine, but could easily have come from the frozen aisle at trader joe\\'s. the green beans looked like green beans, but tasted like nothing. \\n\\non the plus side, the wine was very good., p&k has been one of my favorite spots for a long time, and my boyfriend and i come in very regularly, often for the burger and beer selection. we were very excited about the renovation and reimagination that recently took place and stopped in sunday night to check it out. i am so sad to report this, but our experience left much to be desired. \\n\\nfirst, one of our favorite beers that had been a mainstay for some time disappeared (but whatever). but then, the unthinkable happened. i tried to order their famous burger, as i have done many times before, and found out that it is an entirely different concept now (i guess due to the new chef?). first, i was told they could not cook it to any particular temperature (it only comes medium. what?). then it came out and was two thin patties smothered in american cheese and grease on a somewhat lame bun. also, the meat fell apart each time i took a bite. it tasted like a shake shack burger, which i enjoy, but in a very different i\\'m-starving-and-hungover-and-want-greasy-crap kind of way. the p&k burger was sheer perfection, and they ruined it. why?? we waited a long time to get our food, and my boyfriend\\'s steak was cold by the time it arrived. the restaurant was not busy at all at the time. the waitress graciously corrected the problem, and my boyfriend said his food was really good in the end, but we walked away feeling like this was not the p&k we\\'ve come to know and love.\\n\\ni hope things improve because i don\\'t want to have to find a new favorite neighborhood bar/burger go-to., way, way, way over rated! over priced and filed with williamsburg hipster wannabes. the best burger in philly? i think not!  i requested medium on my burger and received a hockey puck from the flyers last stanley cup.   meritage, directly across the street is much better as is shake shack, whiskey village, butcher and singer and bareburger.  the wings are average at best and the drinks are weak enough for a quaker to consume. oh, and it\\'s loud!!!! have you heard of egg shell sound proofing?  they\\'re much better options in this city. don\\'t believe the hype!!!!, stumbled into the pub and kitchen, literally.  while there is a menu posted outside there is no signage.  we saw two happy center city types coming out and decided let\\'s try whatever this is.  the small bar area was packed, mostly with men, 20/30 somethings in after work/happy hour mode.  it was deafeningly loud even moving back to the small dining area. it was only after being presented with menus that we discovered where we were and knew we had struck dining gold.  we had theater tickets and an extremely early curtain so we had time for only drinks and entrees.  service was efficient and pleasant and as the dining area filled and the bar depleted we could enjoy some converation.  we both ordered the blue cod and a side of cauliflower gratinee.  superb for both.  the fish was flakey, mosit sitting abed a puree of parsnips covered in thinly sliced chorizio, fingerling potatoes, pickled blood and regular orange slivers. it was so delicious.  the side of cauliflower was crispy crusted with a light bechamel sauce underneath instead of smothering it. for dessert we ordered the chocolate bread pudding.  it was almost cakelike in texture with a filling that was pretty solid and tasteless even though we were told it was peanut butter and caramel. it had a scoop of peanut butter/caramel ice cream that was very creamy and lived up to its components flavors. it sat in a pool of caramel sauce that was rich and dark and the proper consistancy.  too bad about the center of the pudding as it ruined the dessert and stopped this meal from being ****., where to start.... i have given this place much thought. after many visits, i always left feeling like a victim of the best pr team in philly. they pay for publicity and it shows. the food, in everyone of my experinces here, has been just ok. i order the lobster bisque the first time i was there around their opening and it was good, every other time i\\'ve been back it seems to get worse. \\nthe burger in my opionion is not that good. it\\'s a bacon cheeseburger. that\\'s it. it\\'s really nothing special, everytime i\\'ve ate this burger ( 4 times now ) it\\'s been way overcooked and extremely salty. at first i thought it maybe was the bacon, tried the bacon, and actually the bacon needed salt. so i told my self not to order the burger next time back. \\ni\\'ve tried to like this place. but the last time i went really made my mind up for me. i sat down with the girl and some friends after drinking over priced middle of the road beers, glanced at the menu and saw meatloaf. now i\\'m not the person to seek out meatloaf, but i figured if anyone can make a bangin meatloaf their chef can. so holding my excitement back i ordered the meatloaf in anticapation of what was ahead of me. i was thinking best meatloaf ever. so the server arrives to the table and places the food down in front of everyone, and i front of me he lies a pulled pork sandwich. i\\'m confused, the table is confused after hearing me order the meatloaf and talking about how it may erase the memories of horrid meatloafs past. after 10 minutes of sitting there with no server to be found i ate this pile of garbage they called pulled pork. i never said anything out of fear of what i may said to the server, i was extremely pissed. \\n\\nthat being said i will never walk through those doors again. after spending hundreds of dollars in this establishment, i give up. hopefully the money i have spent here will go to one more month of pr. they will surely need it, without the hype this place is just another bar. nothing more. \\n\\nalso the spotted pig called they want their menu back., i came here not realizing until it was too late that they had changed the chef/menu. before, this place was apparently known for great burgers. i ordered a cheeseburger and it was drowned in sauce. it wasn\\'t very good due to the fact and it leaked all over the side salad i had, which was decent, but come on, it\\'s just a side salad. i also shared 2 of each kind of oyster since it was about half off during happy hour. the oysters were good., i live a block away so thought it was about time to try this place out! i\\'m a burger fan and saw that theirs was listed as one of the best in philly. naturally, i had to try it out for myself. reasonably priced, but was disappointed to learn that cheese was $2 extra. sadly, i was disappointed again to find hardly any cheese on my burger! you\\'d think they would pile it on if you\\'re paying extra for it. the burger itself was good, but nothing special. haven\\'t tried anything else on the menu but won\\'t be ordering the burger again!, pub & kitchen has a great reputation in philadelphia, and i was looking forward (after several years passing by on work trips) to give it a try. for the price and all the hype, it really was disappointing. i got the deviled eggs (which were cute, but tasteless) and the gnocchi (which was huge and pasty and not good at all). my dinner companion and i split the fries, which were the best part. (but honestly, all fries are good fries, right??) finally, service was friendly, but not all that engaging. given all the wonderful food to choose from in philly, i will not be back to pub & kitchen., it was zinski s.\\'s birthday. we tried to take her to pumpkin prior to our train back to dc. but...the conference let us out at 4:00 and a very strange set of circumstances had me, lino j., mags, and zinski s. at the door of pumpkin around 5:15 and it didn\\'t even open until 6:00 plus we didn\\'t have any wine and it was a byob. some guy with a scruffy beard standing outside of pumpkin suggested we go to pub and kitchen. i didn\\'t want to do it. i had no idea about pub and kitchen. the \\'net was acting funny and i couldn\\'t get on yelp mobile. plus we\\'d released our taxi and had to walk 4 blocks in the cold and wind and with our suitcases. ugh! not happy. \\n\\nwhen we finally got there, it was only a few other parties in the place and we were seated right away. the hostess was nice enough to let us stow our luggage for free in the \"baby high chair storage area\". thanks! things must be looking up. \\n\\nit was dark in there and they had one votive candle on the table, which we were all vying for to use to read the menu. they ordered a carafe of the house merlot. hmmm. ok. now look. i\\'m no wine snob like miles from sideways but that swill was undrinkable. i was ordering scallops so i ordered a glass of some or riesling. \\n\\nthe scallops were a little overcooked. the pea shoot emulsion and mushrooms were good with them. i don\\'t know it wasn\\'t all terrible. i was just a tiny bit bent out of shape at having my plans highjacked by some dude on the street with a scruffy beard and being seated in a restaurant i had never even looked up on yelp. \\n\\nwhen the bill was paid, i zoomed out of the place without even visiting the ladies room. i flagged down a taxi and waited while the rest of the group caught up. i cannot safely say i would ever go back to pub and kitchen on my own. a strange set of circumstances would have to take me there as i found it only a-ok., meh.\\n\\nwe had one drink and left.\\n\\nthe menu was uninspiring, especially considering the bloated inflated prices. we couldn\\'t get past the prices considering the place, food offered. pretentious. sorry guys., i normally feel like yelp is just a place for people to complain and i usually hate reading negative reviews, feeling like people are just desperate for a space to complain.  \\n\\nhowever, this was one of the worst dining experiences ever.  it ruined what could have been a wonderful evening.  \\n\\ni have always tried to like pub & kitchen.  the overall atmosphere is cool & the food is pretty solid.  however on my last visit our server and manager was so rude there is absolutely no way we will ever go back.\\n\\nthe two of us decided to treat ourselves and go out on a date.  we both thought p&k would be a perfect place.  we order our drinks & meal and it comes in less than 20 minutes.  we were a bit shocked at the rush but continued with our evening.  after 40 minutes our bill comes.  we felt a little rushed but thought maybe our server\\'s shift was up so we paid our bill.  we then look at the time & realize it\\'s only been 40 minutes & decide to get another round of drinks.  we also had a friend join us and ordered a drink as well.  instead of accommodating us, both our server and then the manager insists we get up out of our seats and stand near the bar since we paid our bill.  we were even thinking of getting a dessert but the manager said we still had to get up.\\n\\nwhat a horrible date night and both the female server and the manager were so rude and acted as if they couldn\\'t care less.  \\n\\nthis city is full of friendly and accommodating restaurants so we will be sure to never go back to a restaurant like pub & kitchen who treats their patrons like shit., i had a great first visit but i recently went back and felt slightly tricked when i left! first, when i asked the bartender if she had any amaro\\'s she told me that they only had one, averna. i ordered it but later saw at the end of the bar four other amaro\\'s that she never mentioned to me. p&k, you bartenders should know what their stock includes..\\n\\nthen, i ordered dessert after i was given two options. later, when my friend ordered her dessert, she was given three options, the third being one that i would have ordered if i had been told it existed!! \\n\\ni settled for two mediocre options when i could have gotten my favorites. lame. cruel game p&k., smoked salmon with eggs benedict - they should call it the salmonella special. translucent eggs! translucent!!!! an inedible dish. server never stopped to check on us to take it back and she says \"oh sorry\".....and it stayed on the bill. \\nbad service , bad experience , awful dish., i\\'m not sure why pub and kitchen is getting such lackluster reviews. i went there about a week ago on the worst date of my life. through the awkward conversation, forced laughter and cringes the juicy, tender, delicious windsor burger and crispy fries were the only thing that kept my sanity afloat., not so great, actually.  the churchill burger was not in evidence when we went on a wednesday evening, so i ordered a chicken sandwich.  the chicken caesar sandwich was served on a bun that tasted stale. the flavor of anchovies was so overwhelming that it tasted more like a fish sandwich, and not a great one.  the mcdonald\\'s quality shaved lettuce heaped on it didn\\'t help matters, and the fried chicken breasts on it were bland and tasteless.\\n\\nthe service was excellent, however, and our request to be seated somewhere quiet was granted right away., pub & kitchen used to be a great neighborhood restaurant. they once had a delicious pork banger sandwich, they did a tasty pan fried gnocchi, etc. \\n\\nnot so anymore. went for a late brunch one sunday and i felt like i was eating at a diner in the suburbs. the service was *ridiculously slow*, especially given how empty the restaurant was at 2pm. the duck eggs benedict was awful. the yolks were overcooked and the whites were undercooked and slimy. i don\\'t even know how you can mess an egg up in exactly that way., went here last week with my girlfriend and another couple for dinner.  got seated fairly quickly then proceeded to wait 20 minutes to put our order in, another 10 for our drinks, another 30 for our less than stellar meals and another 20 for our over priced check.  for a $100 meal, i expect it to be at least good to great, this was mediocre at best.  wings looked like they butchered pigeons to get them, very small.  burger was a burger, chicken was chicken and the $20 fish and chips were comparable to a $5.99 filet-o-fish value meal.  go to village whiskey, big thumbs down for p&k.  poor service and regular food at 5-star prices., i so wanted this to be better but when we arrived we were told (as a 3 top) we couldn\\'t pace our own order and we had to place our entire order in and the chef would do it. not cool. ate a few dishes (calamari, tartare, pretzel) which were great but the service style was a total turn off., i had heard so many wonderful things about the burger offerings here. i was so disappointed to find that, on the night i chose to dine in, they had taken their list of burgers down to one - the once famous churchill burger, i believe. i\\'ve had better at five guys. warm bleu cheese just does not do wonders for me - i felt it gave the burger bitter, gritty taste. it couldn\\'t even be redeemed by the fries. the atmosphere is also overwhelmingly noisy on a friday night. the music is in constant competition with customers who get louder and louder with each beer they toss back., it came recommended on the strength of one dish a friend had and loved here, but i\\'m sorry to say this place didn\\'t live up to its hype. it\\'s a typically precious local organic artisanal blah blah blah, and doesn\\'t have a sign outside the building. the portions were noticeably smaller thani was expecting, given their noticeably large price tags. and aside from a tasty cheese plate, the food seemed both bland and incongruous with the other things on the plate.\\n\\nmaybe if i went again and tried some other dishes i might have a better experience, but for these prices i\\'m not about to give it a second chance anytime soon when there are so many other better meals and better values out there., i have tried several times to go and enjoy a meal at pub and kitchen. they are my neighborhood spot. i have never had bad food, when i could get some. i have had unfinished food whisked away, i have been ignored while at the bar. i have never experienced even the remotest of decent service. i am giving up now, i hate to say this but rip pub & kitchen burger.\\n\\ncame back yesterday to check out the new menu (and new chef) and was unfortunately pretty disappointed. first off, this is not anywhere near the best burger in the city anymore. the whole two small patties thing makes absolutely no sense, especially if they really are blending the meat itself. it just leads to overcooked meat, which doesn\\'t taste good. it needs to be one large patty so that it can be ordered as something other than well-done. also, the cheese is tasteless. the previous burger had such a great chedder/bleu/something else mix and had so much flavor, and not it\\'s a utterly tasteless thin slice of american cheese. add in a tiny piece of lettuce and no tomato (even though the menu said tomato) and an overly hard piece of bread, and you have a boring burger. the pickles and mayo were necessary additions, but it\\'s saying something when the mayo is the best part. the burger needs something like bitter greens to balance the sweetness of the pickles and something salty to complement the seasoning of the burger. bacon, it needs bacon.\\n\\nthe fries were also disappointing. our resident potato expert in the group identified that the potatoes were not soaked in water before being fried, leading to all of the starch remaining in the fries and resulting in rock hard fries. hard to eat. \\n\\nit wasn\\'t all bad though. the suckling pig bouchons were great, especially with the capery, lemony sauce served with them. there\\'s also a decent beer list (not as interesting as it used to be but still fine) and some interesting cocktails. \\n\\nall in all, it\\'s still not a bad neighborhood spot, but it\\'s not a bright and shining light like it used to be. i used to love the place and the food, but with so many other gastropubs in the area, i\\'m not sure how long it will take to make it back., i must have ordered the wrong thing.\\n\\npub & kitchen has a welcoming outdoor appearance. it almost looks like the side of a barn, and their trees that line the street are decorated with white lights. inside it is truly lovely, warm and cozy, with dimmed lights, booths, and an accommodating staff- hence the three star rating. i wanted my meal to be delicious, i wanted this place to be my new go-to, i really did. but like i said, i must have ordered the wrong thing.\\n\\ni got the soup of the day, which was a carrot-ginger bisque, topped with a swirl of cream and a few cooked shallots. it was served warm, not hot (i like my food served extremely hot) and to be honest, the dish was just too shallow to charge $7 a bowl. tasty, but it didn\\'t blow my mind. and they didn\\'t even include a piece of bread. \\n\\nmy arugula salad was not anything like it was described. supposedly \"tossed with roasted root vegetables,\" the arugula was topped with raw, tasteless veggies with an equally tasteless vinaigrette. i asked the kind server to bring me more dressing, which is something i have never done in my entire life. it didn\\'t really help. towards the end of my salad, i found some kind of rock/seed hybrid that felt like it cracked my tooth. i sent back the salad and it was comped.\\n\\ni am willing to give the place another shot, if only because i\\'ve heard so many other good things. i\\'ll order the right thing next time., last night\\'s experience takes p&k down a notch in my book. the charcuterie plate was large but disappointing in quality, and the special mussels (cooked in beer instead of wine) were a flop with the folks at my table. hopefully this was a one-time misstep. i\\'ll try the place again in a few weeks and hope for a meal more in line with my past experiences., the first thing i noticed upon walking in was the really pretty lighting and cozy feel- which was completely disrupted by a huge, glaring television over the bar. we had planned on sitting at the bar, but the tv was literally bathing the entire middle of the restaurant in horrible blue light. the food was okay, good taste but heavy with a lot of salt. not really many light / healthy menu options aside from a boring salad. service was good. no immediate plans to go back, i was disappointed by this hyped-up gastropub. very crowded, standoffish staff. the crowd is sort of the \"i graduated from an expensive private college and found my first job but mom and dad are still helping me out...hopefully i\\'ll be moving to nyc soon\" type. dunno, just my impression based on my short time at the bar and in the dining room. the food was overpriced. the pork chop was dry and sparsely decorated on presentation. we just wanted a couple good drinks and some tasty gastro comfort food, but for the price we paid we could have gone to a number of other excellent places. maybe i should have tried the churchill burger. next time? not sure i\\'ll return to p&k. wasn\\'t terrible, wasn\\'t all that good., tried numerous items from the menu. \\nfood we liked: ricotta stuffed radicchio and the brussel sprouts. \\nfood we didn\\'t like: the meatballs (way too salty), the potato soup, the parker house rolls and whitefish, the crostata (which wasn\\'t as horrible as the rest), the mussels, and the deviled eggs (which were terrifying). \\nnot sure we would eat here again., the bartenders are inept and make it obvious that they have never learned any form of mixology.   the ingredients they use are not fresh, nor are they locally produced, additionally, their \"food\" is over-salted, which is a cheap trick to get  naive people to order more drinks.  they don\\'t even use proper salt, just cheap table salt, which is pathetic, considering their prices.  i don;t mind paying top dollar.....but only if the quality of the ingredients reflect the prices.  \\n\\nif you are already drunk, but are hungry, you won\\'t mind the substandard quality of the grub at p & k., in a nutshell, i\\'m not impressed. although the place has a good energy, it\\'s very loud for dinner, especially if they sit you anywhere near the bar. we started with a cheese plate which was quite average. i had the skirt steak, which lacked flavor and was served barely warm. my wife had the gnocchi which she thoroughly enjoyed. with three cocktails, two cups of (awful) coffee and a really good chocolate cake for dessert, the bill came to $115. while not incredibly expensive for dinner in philly, i still expect better in that price range. with so many better options in philly, i can\\'t see ever going back., we came in for drinks and we snacked on something, i dont really remember what it was. we were drinking whiskey. anyway this place is pretty nice. maybe too nice to go for \"just drinks\". a friend of mine was flirting with some guy and they were \"playfully\" throwing napkins at each other and then the off-duty bar tender flipped out hardcore. he threatened to \"shit on her pillow\". we all laughed but he seemed pretty serious. we just laughed and told him to fuck off. we left and went to grace tavern, which is a way different bar, but its okay to flirt there. no one is going to shit on your pillow., still scratching my head over this one, especially after the big review in the inquirer.  with a party of 8 we were able to sample a real cross section of the menu.  it was a nice monday night and yet things got busy quickly.  it doesn\\'t seem that people go there just to drink but maybe the bar gets busy later.  the main room has low ceilings which amplified the noise to airplane hanger levels.  oddly, they insisted on pumping music into the mix of noisy banter.  but the food is the what is key.  unfortunately, it was underwhelming with a few exception.  the grilled calamari appetizer was nicely done with a twist as the sections were stuffed with a lovely chopped vegetable and grain mixture with solid flavors and texures.  the salads were quite good but not a measure of brilliance.  similarly the steak and fish dishes passed the test but one should not judge a kitchen by dishes a good cook can do just as well at home.  show me something unique or complex.  the entrée that beckoned was the heralded rabbit meatballs and polenta.  while the polenta was very nicely done, the showpiece was a major disappointment.  the meatballs were dense, dry and flavorless unless one considers including the recommended daily allotment of salt placed in one dish to be enticing.  the wine list is limited and overpriced for what it is.  they do not allow a corkage and so one is stuck with few choices.  all in all, it struck us as a place that believes the hype and does not have the objectivity to evaluate it\\'s product accurately.\\nnot a place i\\'d try again, too many other great options., i live in the neighborhood and have been to p&k many times. went tonight for dinner with a party of 4. ordered drinks, dinner, and dessert. food was good, as always. however, about 10 minutes after we paid the check (still finishing our drinks), our waitress came over and asked us to leave because they had other reservations. we\\'d never experienced anything like it. i won\\'t go back., met some girlfriends for dinner here. i hadn\\'t been in like a decade since it was revamped and always heard good things, so i decided to give it a whirl again. it looks great. love the ambiance. it\\'s darkly lit with cool stringed lights that don\\'t look as tacky as it sounds. the food was great too. i had oysters and a delicious cheeseburger, which they\\'ve always been know for and 3 tall double stoli and clubs. then the check came. besides this place being waaaaay over priced, they charged me for each shot in my drink!!! so my 3 drinks cost $60!!! i\\'ve never been to a restaurant where you order a double and they charge you per shot. i called the manager over and he was very nice, taking off 1 drink saying their doubles are \"true doubles\" where as most places do a shot and a half for doubles and up charge 4 or 5 bucks. um, ok. then tell your patrons that before i order my gazzillion dollar vodka club. the place handled the situation well, but i won\\'t be back., i\\'ve been to p & k several times and the food is always on point.  they are the only restaurant that has ever gotten me to eat peas and like it (the mushy peas with the fish and chips are where it\\'s at).\\n\\ni was at the bar having a couple of drinks with a buddy and decided to order the pulled pork (which i inhaled).  i was craving fries but i didn\\'t want the full $7 order of fries because i wasn\\'t going to eat them all by myself. when i asked to substitute the side salad for some fries they were adamant that it would violate their no substitution policy.  funny that the last time i was there, they served the fries as a side. plus, who in the hell gets a salad with a pulled pork sandwich?\\n\\nbottom, line is this place has to get their priorities straight.  you are a bar and not a high end restaurant so you want to accommodate your patrons, within reason, to give them incentive to come back.  i\\'m sure the finances of the place will not crumble if they throw 30 fries on the plate in lieu of a salad.  otherwise, knock down the price of the fries by $2-3 dollars and i\\'m not online tonight writing a rant about your poor attitude towards your customer., had to walk out of here yesterday, which was disappointing because it used to be one of our favorite places in the neighborhood. it was pretty dead around 3:30pm when we walked in, and could not get a bartender\\'s attention for 10 minutes. fine, whatever, it\\'s a sunday, no biggie. when the \"bartender\" in the pink sweater was finally ready to grace us with her hospitality (ha!) we asked if she could please turn the college basketball game off of 1 tv, whenever she had a moment. afc championship game was on. i fully recognize that this isn\\'t a sports bar, but they do have 2 large tvs and there\\'s football games on here all the time. she kind of grunted/laughed, said \"what football game?!\" then told us no - someone was watching the (now over) nova game. there was no one around the tv. she never offered a solution, even after we kindly told her that game was now over. suffice it to say, i understand why she works sunday brunch shift. we got up and left and spent our $150 at a neighborhood competitor, with far better service. being condescending to repeat customers is not a very bright business model, and i\\'d be embarrassed to employ someone with her aptitude for service. pathetic., this place is over-rated, beer selection is for amateurs and food menu is bare. if you want to pretend like you know good food and beer go here. if you really know good food and beer, don\\'t., pub and kitchen, i can finally cross you off my list of new places to eat at.  i can now add you to the list of disappointing spots that i\\'m unlikely to ever visit again.\\n\\nmy sister, laura, was visiting this weekend and we went out for dinner.  i gave her a few places to pick from, and i was happy when she chose pub and kitchen.  it\\'s a swanky little spot at 20th and lombard.  they don\\'t take reservations, so we had to wait around at the bar until a seat opened outside and we could enjoy the beautiful weather.  the tap list here isn\\'t great; they have english beers on to go with the pub feeling, but i\\'d rather just have some stuff that is better and reasonably priced.  i drank thomas hooker ipa, which was good and is actually pretty rare to see on tap.\\n\\nthe service here was poor.  we waited too long at the bar for drinks and our table service was slow as well.  the worst part is that all of the servers are dressed like the clients, making it difficult to flag down anyone to help you.  \\n\\nthe atmosphere here is kind of annoying.  it\\'s darker, more crowded, and louder than it should be.  if i wanted that, i go to any number of bars that i like better.  the one good thing is the outdoor seating, because there isn\\'t much car traffic passing by to annoy you as you eat.  the bar has a few tvs, but they\\'re all on the same spot.  i wouldn\\'t recommend this place if you\\'re actually trying to watch anything, but if you want a baseball game on in the background, you\\'ll probably be in luck.\\n\\nthe one saving grace here could be the food.  i had read great things about the windsor burger before coming, and was excited to eat it.  my medium rare burger was properly cooked, and came out with cheddar and bacon.  nothing i ate seemed flavorful enough; everything was lacking.  the entire meal was forgettable.  pub and kitchen also overlooked the importance of good bread on a burger.\\n\\nthe portions here are pretty good, and the table next to us had the cheese platter and oysters which looked like decent appetizers.  they also looked like you could get better elsewhere.\\n\\nbottom line: meh., holy holy holy christ.  how in the world is this dude george still working here and diarrhea-spraying all over customers??  i totally forgot i had a yelp account until i i ran into this chubby shithead at the bar again when a couple of good friends told me to swing through to p&k.  to be fair, he was fine with me but rolling his eyes and just being a pretentious dick to a bunch of people there.  i dunno, whatever, my bonus check clears tomorrow and this dude is still here being a miserable sob so i guess that makes me feel better., such a disappointment for a restaurant in my neighborhood. if it were up to me, i\\'d love this place, or maybe at least like it, but that\\'s not the case. i\\'m kind of tired, so i\\'m just going to bullet point why this place was less than \"meh.\"\\n\\n1) service was terrible. our waitress forgot my drink order and half of my entree. she also took my boyfriend\\'s beer away before he was finished. that is so annoying. \\n\\n2) food was sub par. the oysters on special were small, and for the price, never again. my \"warm beet and apple soup\" was cold and had zero flavor. here is where i will concede...my side of \"bitter greens.\" i should have taken p&k literally, because this side dish was horrendous. even if the dish was delivered on time (which it wasn\\'t), i would not have finished it. my boyfriend\\'s pork shoulder sandwich was satisfactory, but he didn\\'t really care for it. we didn\\'t stay for dessert.\\n\\n3) it was freezing outside and the windows were open. it\\'s not really my thing to dine with my coat on. \\n\\nthe menu is limited. it would be nice to see more selection. p&k is not worth the price by any means. if i return, it will be for a safe glass of wine from the bar. \\n\\nsorry, p&k, this was not good., i have been to p&k once and likely wont be back.  the fries are price gouged on account of the truffled mayo; it is over-priced in general.  the food, however, is tasty.  the beer selection is rather paltry when this place clearly bills itself as a gastropub.  the social scene of this place embodies all of the worst stereotypes of gentrification.   it seems that it is patroned by people from manayunk who are bored with their brewery, or by people from manayunk who have screwed up the courage to move south of south.  there is no comingling; there is no neighborhood pub feel.  many there are interlopers, and are likely the ones i see driving through the city with their crossover vehicles tossing starbucks cups out of their speeding windows because, hell, the city is dirty anyway and they live in the burbs or manayunk., somewhat disappointing. had the pulled pork sandwich. partner had the parliament. not bad, but certainly better values to be found. meh., i have been to many of gastropubs in my day...this place is by far the worse. i hope people read yelp before they go! i wish i did....\\n\\nthe service was ok, the waitress was well versed and babbling fancy menu specials off like i was at parc or le bec fin. first, i thought to myself, wow this place really is selecting quality ingredients- this must be good! wrong.\\n\\npositive note: we ordered drinks and they were amazing! \\n\\nafter that we ordered oysters which were a bit gritty and i think i may have chipped a tooth! whatever. i was excited for my short rib meal and my boyfriend looking forward to the braised pork shoulder sandwich. boy was i disappointed. i usually enjoy fall-off-the bone chima-style short rib (i mean i was paying the same price technically!!!). it was extremely dry with maybe a half a cup of soggy veggies underneath. my boyfriend\\'s sandwich was so dry and there wasn\\'t even a side of sauce! no fries either?!! i guess those were extra... we also ordered a questionable chicken stuffing that was so burnt it was sticking to the griddle it came out on. i regret i was not watching my mother\\'s dog so i could have feed him my leftover meat. \\n\\nso all this garbage for a bill over $100. that does not make you feel too good paying for a bad meal. never will i ever come back here - and i hope others take notice., 5 minutes sitting at the bar and no service from the bartender or other  staff wasn\\'t overly crowded either., seriously? so over rated, will not go back! they must have relatives who work at phila magazine who keep the place on a list! went for the burger, it was supposed to be medium rare and was served charcoal burned! even the waitress said it looked awful. since it took 45 minutes to be served, we were not willing to wait another 45 minutes. when the chef was given our business card from a newspaper, he came running down lombard st after us apologizing for sending out bad food! he said he would have made it better if he had known we were from the newspaper!! won\\'t go back for that reason alone! doesn\\'t everyone deserve well made food?, went here tonight for restaurant week, and i must say i was a little disappointed. my friend and i had made the decision to go here over a few other popular restaurants because we liked what was on the menu that was posted on the restaurant week page. when we got to the restaurant, however, the options that were available on the menu in front of us were considerably different than what the restaurant had provided on the menu of the restaurant week website. \\n\\ni chose deviled eggs as my first course, which i must say were absolutely delicious. the only issue was that the serving was 2 halves of a single hard-boiled egg, which definitely left me wanting more. my friend chose the charred shishito peppers and avocado, which quite literally was a large bowl of shishito peppers and chopped avocado. we were not impressed by the disproportionate appetizer sizes and the fact that my friend\\'s appetizer seemed haphazardly thrown together, as she was expected to eat a bowl of whole peppers and chunks of avocado with no bread/chips/anything else that one would normally eat this type of food on. i don\\'t know about anyone else, but picking up flavorless pieces of avocado with a fork just doesn\\'t seem appealing to me.\\n\\nmy main meal was the bucatini, which was supposed to come with mushrooms, smoked fennel, and a carbonara sauce. it was almost impossible to taste anything over the artificial smokey flavor that completely overpowered the dish. additionally, they totally covered the dish in rosemary leaves, which felt like i was literally eating mouthfuls of pine needles. again, not impressed.\\n\\nfor dessert, i had the panna cotta, which was good but was overpowered by a rosemary flavor (?). i mean throwing some vanilla bean or espresso in there would have made sense, but rosemary?! there was no flavor that tied it together, so it tasted like sweet rosemary jello. no good.\\n\\noverall, the place itself was very cute and had a nice ambiance. service was good as well. the food just didn\\'t seem good enough to come back, especially at the steep steep steep prices that these dishes normally go for. if i had paid one cent more for this meal, i would have been very angry. there\\'s better restaurants out there for the price., $17 fried chicken was bad.  it\\'s two dark meat drumsticks and a thigh because they\\'re too cheap to give you a good breast. also it has paper thin breading rather than a good crunchy fry., waiters dress distractingly casual - plaid shirts and worn-in jeans. lack of formality and (worse) lack of detail in descriptions of specials and the cheese plate that we ordered. no vegetarian entrees. three vegetarian appetizers. i asked the waitress for advice about the charred broccolini dish and decided to order it - and i was surprised / disappointed when the dish turned out to be served cold.  great drinks but overall, with $23 entrees, felt like a waste., someone please explain to me what the all the hype is about this place? my husband and i went to dinner here and i was not impressed. not impressed with the menu, the food, or the restaurant/bar itself.\\n\\n\\nit was so poorly lit inside i was struggling to read the menu, so much so that i got a headache, and when i leaned towards the mini candle on our table to see better, i almost set the menu on fire! this is not how anyone pictures their first few minutes of a dining experience. \\n\\nfor me it was overpriced for what they were providing. i doubt i\\'ll be back., so i just came out of pub and kitchen. i walked out after sitting at my table with my boyfriend for 20 minutes and no one came over to greet me or even fill up my water glass. considering there was just one other couple in the whole entire bar on a monday night, the only logical explanation is that they didn\\'t serve us because we were black. pub and kitchen is a racist establishment and i would suggest that no one goes there. \\nit is 2016 and we have to make a stand on closing down racist establishments in the philadelphia area., the food tastes good.  but, if you are hungry you will leave hungry.  small plates.  we(2 people) ordered two snacks(appetizers) and two plates(they call it first course).   the prices say two dollar signs on yelp, but i think the value vs food quantity should be three dollar signs., food is terrible and the wait is worse. took an hour for the food to show up. my eggs were inedible. they were nominally supposed to be scrambled but they came out cold and soggy - as if they were over beaten? not sure what they did but they were worse than powdered. the fried chicken is cheap cuts of dark meat - tasteless and absurdly over priced. don\\'t come here. there are much better places for a meal in philly., nice place and friendly staff, but wow, the food was dreadful. the deviled eggs tasted sour, the clams were amazingly too salty, the pasta dish had zero flavor and the veggie burger had a weird blend of spices. if you\\'re coming for the drinks and loud atmosphere, this is your spot. stand clear from the food. not worth it., ate there yesterday with my fiancé.  great service, but the food was terrible.  my fiancé got food poisoning which led to her needing to go to the er.   i highly recommend never eating here., i\\'m a fan of pub & kitchen. i like their menu and the service is generally pretty good. however, my last visit 7-2-18 was not a good one. i grabbed dinner with a friend and we both ended up ordering the burger. we both requested substitutions. neither of us got what we asked for. the burgers were undercooked. i asked for no fries and of course they were on my plate. i added bacon and the bacon was overcooked. my friend asked for no cheese and there was cheese on the burger. not the usual from pub & kitchen but when i\\'m dropping $70 for drinks and burgers, i expect better service and execution., i sent two requests for info to them. no response! if the management is that rude, how good can the servers be?, we went there on a saturday night. our food was edible but nothing special. but our service was horrible. our appetizer came within 15/20 minutes. dinner came and hour and fifteen minutes later. the whole time the server did not come to check on us. i was starving and my husband had to go find the waiter. it took us a long time to locate her. the manager came and apologized and offered us a round of drink and that we had to wait another 20 minutes. overall, we went to celebrate a friend\\'s belated birthday and the whole evening was ruined. we always go to meritage, which is across from pub and kitchen, and thought we would give this place a chance. however, it was a bad idea. in that price range there are so many better option, i do not know how they are in business.\\n\\nchicken wings were okay. too sweet for my taste.\\nthe escargot was not good at all.\\nour bolognese sauce pasta was edible.\\nthe tuna was not bad., this is the very first review i\\'ve ever written in my life. im quite easy to please when it comes to food and drinks but my experience at this place was so awful it made me feel like this was necessary. i got the poached eggs with pork that should have been called porkless salsa verde soup with two tortillas messily thrown in and drenched. and for almost 20$? ridiculous! and most of the menu is crazy over priced for such mediocre food. our server was awful. barely checked on us, was completely rude, and acted like we were such an inconvenience to her!! ironically, everyone in our table is also in the service industry and knows how to treat a customer, but she clearly didnt., we live close by & have stopped by a couple of times.   first time great - good wine & beer, attentive but chill service & they even refilled my glass of wine on the house.  second time we went for dinner - the salad & burger were good and we were quite excited about the bread pudding.  \\n\\nthe third time things went down hill.  we have never been so insulted by staff at any establishment.  when i read reviews and see comments such as \"staff were rude,\"  i usually assume the reviewer evoked it somehow.  if we evoked the inappropriate treatment we got, i apologize to the staff.  however, i will never be stepping foot inside that bar again., have been to pub & kitchen in the past and really enjoyed it.  but on this visit the food was terrible.  the dishes were all over-salted with one entrée inedible.  what the food lack, the service made up for.  very attentive and friendly service.  would come back for a drink but definitely not to eat., a few rambling points before i return to sobbing, as if for a lost loved one:\\n\\npub and kitchen has officially sold us all out.\\n\\n1. not one appetizer under $9 - wtf. the side salad costs nine dollars. nine. dollars.\\nwho the hell do they think they are?\\n\\n2. really bad service. it\\'s as if they pride themselves on how bitchy they can be to customers. \\n\\n3. what happened to the menu? this place used to have great food, but for whatever reason, they cut all the good stuff out. \\n\\n4. take a look at many of the recent reviews... they all are pointing in the same direction. the consensus is, this place is beginning to suck. if i could give one star without getting filtered, trust me, i would.\\n\\nthe beer list is the one thing pub and kitchen has going for it. unfortunately for p&k, there are plenty of places in philly to have a good beer. \\n\\nso let\\'s review: overpriced (this is not coming from a cheap-ass), bitchy, underwhelming, and sucky.\\n\\ntake it from me: go anywhere else. stick your face in a box fan. save your $9. the humanity., i have been here several times, and i really loved it, but after last night will not return.  i gave it a star for drinks....which are always excellent and a star for service....the wait staff was really good.  the food was not good......kale salad was super salty, and i love salty food.  portions were really small, especially for the price and quality.....there was barely any fish inside the batter of the fish and chips.  the char didn\\'t come with the vegetables listed.  the carmel pudding dessert is awful, but maybe i\\'ve been ruined for any other since the version at barbuzzo is so divine.  i know they are getting a new chef....blah, blah, blah, but there are so many fantastic restuarants in the city  not sure going back is worth the time or risk.  i can not believe this place stayed in the inquirer\\'s top 50., i\\'ve always liked the staff and the space is great but the food has slipped over the years and in it\\'s current form (may 2013) the wine is horrid and the beer isn\\'t much better.  menu is awkward and inconsistent and has lost it\\'s neighborhood \"pub and kitchen\" concept.  no need to stop in for a bite when it\\'s in the high $20\\'s, tastes average at best and is accompanied by a very poor wine and beer list, i was here about a year ago and though i don\\'t remember what i ordered i definitely enjoyed my experience.  i went yesterday though and it was a whole different story.  my party of three\\'s deviled egg appetizer was overly salty.  i ordered the cheeseburger as did one of my other friends (only because the entree she\\'d originally wanted was sold out).  she found hers way too salty.  when she told the waiter he was very nice and apologetic about it and offered to get her something else.  my burger on the other hand was very good but the fries were some of the greasiest i\\'ve ever encountered in my life-yuck.  the three of us split a small chocolate pudding dessert and it was delicious but incredibly rich, more than one small ramekin split three ways would have been too much to handle.\\n\\non top of this sub-par experience i began to feel ill about and hour after the meal and was stricken with food poisoning that lasted a few hours [tmi but it was coming out of both ends].  i\\'m not someone with a sensitive stomach and this has only happened to me one other time in my life.  \\n\\ni was especially disappointed because i know that the people who run pub & kitchen also run the diving horse in avalon, one of my favorite restaurants where i\\'ve never had anything but a fantastic meal.  \\n\\nbottom line: if you want heavy, salty, greasy food that might get you sick, save your money and go to mcdonalds., i went here after seeing the reviews about their famous burger. the burger was good but nothing special. it certainly wasn\\'t worth the $18. it should have been priced at $10 absolute max. my sister had the cod and the orange pieces in the dish were off putting. it\\'s very nicely decorated and the drinks are only about $6-10 so i would go back for drinks and the atmosphere, but not for the food., whatever, have experienced worse, have experienced better.  the bartender girl was rude - so thumbs down right off the bat., i really want to love this place since it\\'s only a block from my apartment... i\\'ve given it many tries but i guess it\\'s just not meant to be.\\n\\nduring my last experience, i tried to go there for brunch and sat outside for a good 15 minutes without even getting served water...  seeing how slow the service was going to be, my friends and i decided it wasn\\'t worth the wait and just left. didn\\'t really feel bad since we weren\\'t even acknowledged by anyone yet.\\n\\nthe other times i\\'ve been, service was also slow but tolerable and the food is actually pretty good. however, the servers seem to really try and push drinks on you and seem disappointed when you decline. plus side is that their bread, grilled gem salad and sandwiches/burgers are good. but there\\'s a lot of \"good\" places in philly so if your service isn\\'t on par, it\\'s just not worth the hassle of going back., i\\'m not sure why everyone seems to like this place so much.  i\\'ve had drinks here in the past and they seemed ok, nothing memorable.  i recently had dinner and i feel the same way about it.\\n\\nwe were quickly seated and water was brought over to the table.  the server filling our water said with conviction \"enjoy!\" which seemed appropriate, since the water was all we had for a very long time.  after waiting and waiting, the server finally came over to take our drink order, we ordered drinks and food at the same time.  then we waited some more.  the food and drinks seemed to take a really really long time to come out.  i also overheard a conversation at the table to my left, where the waitress had forgotten ordered items, but still charged for them, and the table to my right, where the waitress forgot to take their food order altogether.  it wasn\\'t a very busy night, so i\\'m not sure what the issue was. \\n\\nafter drinking the average drinks, and eating the 5/10 food, i wasn\\'t impressed.  i don\\'t think i\\'ll be back., the short of it: if you like cave echo ambiance, questionable expenditures of time/money, and mediocre bar food that laughably pretends to be sophisticated bar food, you will be surrounded by plenty of your peers at pub & kitchen. \\n\\nthe long of it: i was really looking forward to my meal here, i swear. the pictures and description of this place in bridge and tunnel monthly - i mean philadelphia magazine - gave my stomach an erection, which i didn\\'t even think was physiologically possible. my lust for pub & kitchen motivated me to give the place shot on an otherwise typically unremarkable weeknight. \\n\\nupon arriving, i waited a few minutes before being led by my server through an increasingly dark, cacophonous, narrow corridor made out of drunk people until i finally reached the eating area at the back of p&k. why pubs subject patron and server alike to the natural consequences of thickheaded layout is beyond me. \\n\\ni started off with wings (the sweet variant), followed by a pulled pork sandwich and fries. quite frankly, the wings were embarrassing. every last one was overcooked to the point of crunchiness. \"off night, maybe\", i thought to myself as i tried to avoid chipping my teeth on what undoubtedly was tender chicken meat prior to crossing the path of the wrong disgruntled p&k line chef. the sauce itself was good, but lipstick/pig. \\n\\nspeaking of pig, the pulled pork sandwich was strictly average. i couldn\\'t taste much of the meat trapped under the accompanying sauce avalanche, but that wouldn\\'t have even bothered me much if the sauce itself was great. unfortunately, it wasn\\'t - you could find better at pathmark. all i\\'ll say about the fries is that i didn\\'t even like them enough to take home with me post-meal. \\n\\nthe servers got the bare minimum done and not much more. they were aloof, largely absent, and quicker to ask me to move over one spot mid-meal than to refill my water. \\n\\nmaybe my stomach needs viagra. maybe this was all a case of me ordering the wrong thing and maybe my experience really wasn\\'t representative of what p&k is capable of. maybe i\\'d rather try dozens of other restaurants than risk finding out if i\\'m right., pretentious and overpriced.  expensive drinks and a country club crowd.  we weren\\'t particularly impressed with the experience vs price point., i mean, it\\'s fine - it\\'s just not worth how much they want to charge. p&k is seeking to walk the tightrope between a neighborhood pub and higher-end english/american fare a la the dandelion, but the food and service just fall too short. if they chopped $2-3 off the price of each menu item and asked their bartenders to amp up the charm a little, it could be really popular, but you\\'ll probably wind up walking away with a massive bill for two drinks and two entrees and wondering why you didn\\'t just eat at home., service was extremely rude.  reserved a table for outside and they tried to make us sit inside, had to argue to get them to follow through on the promise they made for us to sit outside.\\n\\nonce seated, wait staff was super rude.  never once asked how food was and took 15 minutes to pick up the check even though they weren\\'t busy.\\n\\nfood was over salted and i ask d for my burger medium and it was cooked well done. \\n\\nvery disappointed as i had come here a couple of years ago and was very pleased, this place has gone downhill., only been here for happy hour but they\\'re definitely trying to pull one over on you on that one. the highball cocktails were weak af (if there was any alcohol in there), moscow mule was equally weak, the red wine on the happy hour menu was definitely watered down, and the pilsner (only happy hour beer) was fine but was discounted at $4 which is standard and was served in a small pilsner glass that probably held 10oz tops., overrated. i ate here a few years ago when it was a novelty. now i live here and after a few more tries (it\\'s super close and i am lazy) i have to stand by my meh. it\\'s loud, expensive - like new york expensive - and just not worth it. there are much better options in philadelphia now., i don\\'t get it. loud, dark, pricey, and full of bros and d-bags. its popularity is proof that image trumps substance., i and my group of friends has never felt as unwelcome as we did tonight at pub & kitchen.  from the first drink we ordered, the bartenders were rude, insulting, and standoff-ish.\\n\\nin addition,  as soon as the clock struck 2am, one of the bartenders yelled at all of the patrons, \"if you\\'re not my friends or family, or i\\'m not f*cking you tonight, you have to leave immediately.\"  it was rude, obnoxious, and completely off-putting.  and after we confronted her about it, she continued to be rude and treat us like crap.\\n\\nnever in my life have i encountered such an adversarial relationship between a bar/restaurant and the patrons who are spending lots of money there.  i know many people who work in the service industry, and have a lot of regard for those who truly work to make their patrons happy despite the difficulties.\\n\\nthe staff i encountered tonight did not fir this description.  if you want to risk being treated poorly, rudely, and with absolute contempt, then go to pub & kitchen.  if you want a nice experience where you are treated like a valued customer, go somewhere else., this place was awful for brunch.   we were sat in a small room with 2 large groups and a couple with a baby.   the baby was very well behaved but the noise level from the two large groups in such a tiny space made the experience horrible.   add to that tasteless food and horrible service and you have the recipe for never returning., wow, this place was packed on a  wednesday night.\\n\\nif i\\'m going to pay $18 for fish and chips, then there had better be a decent amount of fish.  fail.  half of what was served to me was batter with no filling.  my girlfriend had a better experience but there was still nowhere near enough fish for this premium price point.  the batter itself was good though, the closest to proper english fish batter i\\'ve had in the states.  however, the mushy peas were an abomination.  worst mushy peas...ever.\\n\\nthe beer selection is solid and i think it would be the only reason i\\'d go back.  all their entrees just seem overpriced for what you get.  someone needs to tell the owners that the whole gastropub revolution involved good quality food at normal pub prices, not overcharging for pub classics., oh no, what happened to pub & kitchen?! new owners, new management? this used to be my favorite neighborhood spot for great atmosphere (polished but unpretentious) with refined cuisine and reliably terrific wine selection. sadly not anymore! it\\'s now slipped greatly from all its charms. the bar has been overtaken by huge tvs, the food is greasy and resembles mediocre unhealthy bar fare, and the wines offered are truly sub-standard. it no longer attracts its former discerning crowd either. philly has so many sports bars and pedestrian joints that is dissappoints greatly to see this former gem succumb to mediocrity., ordered two steaks for take-out and they messed up the one somehow. didn\\'t know i had to wait even longer until i arrived to pick up. by the time i got home, the food was cold. they were busy with their dine-in guests, therefore take-out orders are low priority., this place was such a letdown. i have wanted to try this place forever and the food was so disappointing. the service was good, but the food was just not tasty. i tried the burger since i\\'ve heard this place was known for their burgers. it ended up being two smaller burgers that were greasy and grisly. the fries were also not crunchy like you would expect with good fries. it was also really expensive for what it was. i think i\\'ll stick with my usual burger places like good dog and grace tavern., would not recommend ordering the shakshuka for take-out. for $17 you can get a small portion of shashuka that tastes reminiscent of airplane food or a microwaveable dinner., short and sweet: i\\'m glad i can cross p&k off the list, but i wouldn\\'t go back. i came here with a buddy and only had four things:\\n\\n1) mussels\\n2-4) makers mark and coke\\n\\nthe mussels were average at best. there was no slurping of the juicy, delicious broth at the bottom, and my bread/crouton was scorched!  +1 for being cleaned correctly and for being salty...-1 for being underwhelming and severely lacking in flavor. \\n\\nif it wasn\\'t for getting drunk from the drinks, and for my friend liking his burger...which is probably a muchhh better bet at a place like this, i would have given 2 stars. it did have a cool, hip atmosphere though., the bar atmosphere and outdoor dining has always been excellent at the pub & kitchen and a good beer + wine list to boot. what has changed is the food; the menu is strange (e.g. the only chicken dish is for 2 and $48), but the true stab in the heart is the disappearance of the churchill burger to be replaced by something with 2 small patties that is reminiscent of a big mac on a ciabatta roll. it is a true shame, i used to take people here to experience the best burger in town (maybe the best anywhere). i would potentially still stop in for drinks if i was in the neighborhood, but i don\\'t see a reason to go out of my way to make this a dining destination anymore., this bar is such a disappointment. it has a great location, the decor is cool, the food and drink menus are fairly extensive but it is all ruined by the two miserable bar tenders who\\'s face i suspect would crack if they dared smile. i don\\'t need my bar tender to be all up in my grill, but preferably not scowling at me would be a nice start. after giving it several try\\'s i won\\'t go back there now for fear of getting the hairy eyeball from one of the two poisoned dwarfs. they seem to expect us to pay them to ignore us, get our own cutlery, give us evil stares, get the order wrong and not bother them while the stand around with each other.\\nas i said above this place has great potential but is ruined by the servers., the workers at this restaurant were extremely disrespectful and the service was terrible. the waitress told me that i was not allowed to sit in the restaurant if i did not order food, before she asked me what i wanted. when the food did arrive, the food was greasy and over cooked. never ever going back to this place and telling everyone i know to do the same., the artichoke dip was microwaved.\\n\\nthe staff was indifferent and rudely behaved.\\n\\nthe bathrooms were full of flies.\\n\\nthere are flies on my food.\\n\\ni\\'m leaving and never coming back dude., this review is for the brunch only. \\n\\npros: \\n* unlimited (albeit ever-so-slightly watered-down) mimosas.\\n* delightful french fries (not as good as baggataway in conshohocken, but still a solid 7/10).\\n* the french toast that a neighboring diner ordered looked and smelled tasty... from where my husband and i were sitting, anyway...\\n* the not-brunch menus may be much better than the brunch menu...\\n\\ncons:\\n* give or take a couple of items, their brunch menu consists of french toast, mushy fish-n-chips, and about five slight variations of the same breakfast sandwich.\\n* the aforementioned breakfast sandwiches sound tasty, but (at least when we went) are so poorly executed that they are inedible.\\n\\ni ordered one of their breakfast sandwiches and couldn\\'t finish it. i love heavy and flavorful food as much as the next [sane] person, but the cheese on this sandwich was *caked on* and grease literally ran down my arms and face every time i picked up the sandwich and tried to take a bite of it.\\n\\nmeanwhile, my husband had fish and chips, but could not eat more than a few bites. we surmised that the fish had been very badly overcooked because most of it (about 80%) had the consistency of lukewarm lard. (i say \"lukewarm\" because that was the temperature at which it arrived when we finally received our food.)\\n\\nthe experience was especially disappointing because it took *well* over 45 minutes to get our food in the virtually-empty restaurant.\\n\\nbottom line: decent bottomless mimosas for brunch, but stick to those and perhaps a side of fries. *****again, this review applies to the brunch menu only*****\\n\\nwe will try their non-brunch menu at some point and write another review then (hopefully a positive one, as i have heard that their dinner menu may upgrade soon)., don\\'t sit at the bar. the servers love to stand around the kiosk and talk behind each others\\' backs. i was sitting at the bar and could only hear negative comments about the rest of the staff. \"if he puts that glass in the sink yell at him.\" one of the brunette lady servers went as far as coming up to us and saying, \"so does anyone want to pay me or what\" while we were still finishing our meals with the checks recently given to us. i frequent this place and normally love it, but please reconsider your newly hired employees., this place is awful. the whole staff talking bad about everyone who walks in and then are just rude when you are there. definitely don\\'t go here, terrible experience!! we loved the quaint look of bryn mawr, and the grog jumped out at us because it seemed to be exactly what we were searching for. great looking menu, etc. all was well until it took over 45 minutes to receive our food. the restaurant was not at all crowded, and the bartender, gp was avoiding our table, as it was taking entirely too long to receive our order. finally, we were running late to the airport due to this extra delay, so we had to have everything boxed to-go. leaving with over $50 of food in to-go boxes makes you realize that it\\'s definitely not worth your time or money. try out some other restaurant in bryn mawr and get more than average bar food., the grog is unreal esp the staff and bartenders.  if you havent been your missing out. come check it out asap, i\\'ve been there several times and liked there burgers.  last night though my fiancee and i stopped in, and it was her first time.  the burgers came out underdone.  the frech fries were simply disgusting.  the bartender told us they recently switched to \"boardwalk fries.\"  i don\\'t remember boardwalk fries as limp, cold and dripping in grease.  my burger was just ok and my fiancees she said was downright lousy.  not going back., used to love this place but it has really gone to the garbage! went here last week with my boyfriend and the waitress messed up our order we felt bad so we just asked for to go bags. she then decided to give us attitude and threw the check book at me. i asked for the manager and he came over and got into my boyfriends face . never coming back here again!!!!, my s.o. and i had been frequenting the grog maybe once or twice a week for a couple of months. it seemed like the perfect bar in the area for us. casual, clean with decent food & friendly bartenders. it quickly became our go to place and we looked forward to our visits there.\\n\\none evening at the grog, my better half ordered a tenderloin steak salad. she ordered it medium rare. it arrived well done. she very politely alerted the bartender who was more than gracious and understanding about the situation. she went to the kitchen and requested new steak, cooked as requested. \\n\\nwhat arrived was basically cow sushi. red, cold center. it had barely touched a grill. \\n\\nthe cook messed up...but instead of just cooking the order properly, like they should have done initially, they decided to turn it into basically a grudge match...and an insult. \\n\\nbelieve me, it wasn\\'t lost on us. i asked my girl if she wanted to go to the grog the other day, she said \"i\\'m over it since they messed up my steak last time. fuck them.\" \\n\\nit\\'s not a reflection on the ownership, bartenders or waitstaff. this would have been a four star review prior to this incident. one dickhead of a cook can ruin it for an otherwise decent establishment. \\n\\noh well, your loss., if you like rude, surly waitresses, really bad food that makes you feel ill, and mice running around your feet as you eat, then this is the perfect place for you. otherwise, do not eat here., 2 things:\\nfirst, the peppers and onions in my fajitas were burnt, and my husband\\'s reuben was cold in the center. \\nsecond, what\\'s up with the manger making the staff conduct a bar clean in front of a full bar?, only one in the bar at 2pm. the 24 year old mgr stated the cook \"dropped my burger and is making another one\".  took 40mins to make another one?  2 stars for the comp\\'d beer., very disappointed in the grog. they spent a lot of money into making it look fancier, the menu has changed and is very over priced now, and the wait staff seems incapable of paying any attention to detail. ordered turkey burgers and as we were waiting overheard the table behind us complaint about the food already, our burgers come and the order was wrong. the burger was very dry and looked like it was deep fried or something. although i didn\\'t order bacon on it, the bacon they sent it to me with was very unappetizing,looked undercooked and poorly presented. will not be returning unless the prices are cut in half, because that\\'s what it\\'s worth., such a shame\\n\\nthis could be such an awesome place for pub friendly folks to hang out. unfortunately it is a place where college kids get to act like the over privaledge idiots there parents have taught them to be.\\n\\nduring our most recent visit (on quiz night) the bar staff were nice the beers good, the food also good, but the college kids (chocolate starfish) proceeded to try to to dominate the bar and cheat uding their cell phones all way through. the quiz master knew it, the bar staff knew it, everyone in the bar knew it but nothing was done. we\\'ll fair enough, but we shouldn\\'t reward them with prizes, oh opps!\\n\\nas if that wasn\\'t enough the college kids them tried to intimidate my wife and i as we were leaving, shouting abuse and trying to initiate an altacation. which again the staff did nothing about. \\n\\nunfortunately thus ended what was possibly a good experience in to a nightmare. i wouldn\\'t go back there if you paid me., i know its really more a bar, than a restaurant, but if you\\'re looking for irish food based on their \"grog faire\" menu, then do yourself a favor and skip it entirely.  the so-called shepherds pie i had was really more of a vegetable stew with sprinkles of ground beef and a very thin layer of mashed potato and barely any beef taste.  certainly not the shepherd\\'s pie i\\'ve had with more of a lasagna/pastichio consistency than a stew consistency.\\n\\nthe waitress seemed more than happy to take it back and substitute something else, so i asked for something far less ambitious...a double cheeseburger, medium-rare.\\n\\nwhat i got:\\ntwo weirdly shaped patties that look like one pac-man shape and one egg shape.  \\nraw-to-very-rare on the inside, although a touch scorched at the top of one patty.\\n\\nthe manager tried to make it right by offering a free dessert or drinks, but since my dining companion doesnt drink, the whisky-sauce-laden dessert didn\\'t cut it.  i asked that he take off my companion\\'s entree at least, but he couldn\\'t do that according to \"policy\".  and he mentioned that something was said to the \"cook\" about his burger attempt.  \\n\\nanother issue:  the shrimp le grog is described as:succulent black tiger shrimp wrapped in crispy bacon and served with horseradish aioli.  we did get the following:\\n5 distinctly non-tiger-sized shrimp wrapped in bacon that was deep-fried to the point of dryness (i will admit that it was crispy).\\nsome horseradish dressing, maybe it was a base ranch, but certainly not an \"aioli\"\\n\\nthe menu tries to sound impressive and vivid in its descriptions. maybe the original cook who wrote it had some culinary skill, but the guy today apparently never read the menu on what was being offered and what they are supposed to be delivering.   but skipping all that, the half-assed attempt at creating burger patties and cooking them in such a fashion is an utter joke, especially since the interior of the burger could be seen when plated on the bun. \\n\\nmy companion did like her burger and the fries, but i wound up leaving disappointed and hungry., this place used to be a solid monday lunch location when they had their all-day $0.50 wings. now it\\'s only after 8pm for the wing special. the only reason why i ever go to the grog is for their all-day monday wing special and now it\\'s gone. \\n\\ni won\\'t be returning to the grog to delve into their otherwise mediocre menu. bring back grog mondays!, just had a really horrible experience at the grog which is a shame because i live around the corner and like to give my business to local establishment. the service has always been a bit questionable..not a lot of super friendly wait people but today was the worst. we sat at the bar at 12:45 thinking , it\\'s lunch, not many people here, plenty of time to make our 2pm appointment. put our food order in at 12:50 .. not anything too complicated a salad and a chicken sandwich.. by 1:20 not a sign of our food.. no one checking to let us no when it might be coming. we finally had to ask, but at that point we had no idea when the food was coming and even if it was delivered immediately we would never have had time to eat it. no apologies, nothing. this is pub food.. it\\'s not rocket science and there were people who ordered after us who were served. i hate to say i won\\'t be back since i live so close, but it will probably be a while. we\\'ve had a few bad experiences already and every time we try to give another chance something like this happens, i went to the grog with my friends for the sweet sixteen game yesterday, march 23rd. once inside and waiting to be seated, the manager carded all of us (my guess is because we happen to look young, considering he had not carded anyone else when seating them). let it be known, my friends and i are seniors at villanova, and actually 21+ years old. therefore, i was horribly insulted when the manager didn\\'t let me in because i did not have a second form of id with my picture on it (although i had plenty of debit/credit cards to show him) and he was rude about it too. as a senior, i do not carry my wildcard around because i never need it. someone needs to tell this guy that in the real world, no one ever has a second form of id with your picture on it, unless you want to carry around your passport everywhere. the grog has lost mine and my friends\\'s business indefinitely., just went to the grog for the first time last night, and i\\'m not planning on going back anytime soon. as soon as we sat down, our waitress treated us with an attitude that seemed to suggest we were wasting her time and this attitude persisted throughout the evening, as if we were an inconvenience. she also continually forgot to bring things to the table that we requested numerous times, such as water and napkins.\\n\\nas for the food, the menu seemed to be trying to do too many types of pub fare, so that the individual dishes suffered. the appetizers we ordered (bruschetta and calamari) were subpar versions of what they could have been, and the burger a friend of mine ordered did not seem like anything special given the price. \\n\\nin terms of atmosphere, my friends and i didn\\'t have a problem. typical pub feel. \\n\\noverall though, the poor service really turned me off from here as an eatery. i can only imagine going to get a drink at the bar in the future, but with the other options on the mainline, they\\'d have to have one hell of a special to bring me back., have been to this pub numerous times over the years. found the side salad and steamed vegetable sides to minuscule while charging $6 each. when we question manager stu all he said is that is the way it is. not the right attitude to win over or treat customers with. be careful what you order at the g, first time here... it\\'s a bar. the french onion soup is good. i got the meatloaf and my two meager pieces of meatloaf came dry, no gravy! the mashed potatoes were okay. the mashed potatoes were also sans gravy. the heaping pile of fancy vegetables dwarfed my meatloaf. they looked healthy, hot, ample, and fancy. i\\'m sure some young millennial would have enjoyed them. unfortunately, i came for the meatloaf and it sucked! next time i\\'ll get bar food. you would be wise to do the same., holy crap, could we stop for a second and just reflect on what they\\'re offering here? i mean 50 cents wings, and i think like 1.50 or 2.00 coors light? i\\'m sorry, i\\'m sure we\\'re all picky eaters, and genuine aficionados of fine dining. \\n\\nbut if you don\\'t like this kind of place there is something wrong with you. like literally something deep rooted, festering & pestering, and disgustingly wrong with you. i mean if you open up a person who doesn\\'t like the grog you\\'d probably find a miniature alien version of richard simmons controlling the person from some awkward alien cockpit. \\n\\nalso try the hot beef au jus, and ask for horseradish sauce. i mean if that doesn\\'t make you happy, then you\\'re hopeless. plus all the bartenders and waiter/waitresses are extremely nice and helpful in every way. but again won\\'t act like you\\'re their best friend in the whole world!, 1) the bartenders are slow/untrained, wasting a beer for every one they pour (it\\'s actually amusing watching them attempt to pour beer), and would rather socialize than be timely. there have been times as i watch my guinness sit (before being topped off) as the bartenders remain oblivious. my favorite moment was when the bartender was standing right in front of me for 10 minutes straight talking to another \"customer\" while i was trying to get her attention. i had to ask another staff member to go around and top off my drink for me (she didn\\'t even realize i got my drink after the fact either).\\n2) they have a table right next to a basement door where they store beer and what not. one would think that employees are trained to announce themselves or knock to let someone on the opposite side know the door is being opened. one day i found myself being hit by the door, and once the man pushing the door open realized i was there, he proceeded to open the door, shoving me into the corner against the wall. i was in utter disbelief...\\n3) overall, the staff is just plain disrespectful. they are not shy from talking about customers right in front of them and have no regard for the image of the establishment.\\ni probably will still come here though because the fries are bomb, but if you\\'re looking for a place where staff don\\'t talk behind your back, ignore you, and disregard quality service, it is best to avoid coming here, i was at quizzo night at the grog for the first time tonight. as a villanova senior, i was so excited to participate for the first time and have a fun competitive night with my friends. unfortunately, my excitement was met with the most unpleasant waiter, who snapped at my friends and i for our id. after handing them over and watching him closely examine our id, as if he knows what to look for without using a light, scanner, or any other tool, he let us go upstairs. after sitting down, the unpleasantness continued as our waiter came over. he asked us for our drink order, and as we gave it to him he responded with rude and derogatory comments. he proceeded to roll his eyes after snapping at us for a credit card to put on file. luckily we were treated by our actual waitress (because apparently he wasn\\'t our waiter???). she was lovely and very attentive. \\n\\ni maintain that 1 star review as the first two encounters were absurdly rude and truthfully so off putting considering our excitement coming into tonight. \\n\\nwe love the grog and we aren\\'t angry, just disappointed., awful.  expensive and mediocre food. i could not eat their grogg burger. saturated in balsamic vinegar.  yuck. staff was nice but we will not go back., this place is run like an absolute carnival sideshow. we arrived and were not allowed to sit outside because of owner/management. after being escourted  up the dangerous stairs, we were greater by an umpaloop dressed as a waitress. after separating our tables and refusing outlet access, we rarely saw her. she maybe came to our table a total of 3 times during the hour that we were there. i truly enjoyed sitting next to the group of racist villanova frat boys. although they threaten to fight us for looking at them as they made a scene, i think they added much needed flavor to this depressing establishment. definetly would not recommend and hope the establishment reads this., have been to this pub numerous times over the years. found the side salad and steamed vegetable sides to minuscule while charging $6 each. when we question manager stu all he said is that is the way it is. not the right attitude to win over or treat customers with. be careful what you order at the grog, we came here for quizzo on a wednesday night. the upstairs bar was packed, so we stayed downstairs, and planned on getting a long island tower. that\\'s when the fun began.\\n\\nthey told us they wouldn\\'t serve us unless we had backup. all of us being over 21, we happily obliged and showed our ids and backups. the bartender then tried to tell me she couldn\\'t serve me because my real state issued id \"looked funny\" ... being 22 going on 23, i have never been in this situation before. and being a bartender, you would think they should know what a real id looks like. i gladly offered up a third form of id, and still was refused. i asked for the manager, who apologized but said he trusted his bartender. he finally gave in and made me sign some waver thing formally stating to the state of pennsylvania that i\\'m of legal age. what the hell?\\n\\ni get that maybe your bartenders aren\\'t used to seeing an indiana state id, but come the hell on. totally killed the mood and ruined me and myfriends evening., such terrible service. came here for lunch, and it took 5 mins at least after sitting to get menus (they told us to sit anywhere). we didn\\'t get water until our main course which we asked for multiple times. i am still in the restaurant as i write this, waiting for them  to take our card so we can get out of here. food was very meh., this place has had it\\'s troubles since recent good bartenders have left and the grog and has not been able to replace them with quality staff., pretty dissatisfied and disappointed. reviews said this was dive bar with affordable food. this is very expensive especially for what the offer is! we got nachos on the special menu for $5 normally $14. flour tortillas chips burnt and soggy with only toppings on the top later so basically 3/4 plate could not eat. we also ordered french onion soup but it never came so that\\'s another reason for the 1 star. i like the vibe. it\\'s on the main line and probably the reason for the high price. overall not worth it and won\\'t be back., my wife went into the grog after watching a movie at the bmfi. being an irishman, i\\'m always happy to see irish entrees on the menu but i always check for signs of authenticity to ensure they actually know how to make the dishes they are serving. i was very happy to see the shepard\\'s pie was made with lamb and not beef as is the case in a lot of establishments who do not know the difference between a shepard\\'s pie and a cottage pie. \\n\\nwhen the dish arrived i did not recognize it. instead of a baked/grilled cheese covered layer of potatoes, the \"shepard\\'s pie\" had a minimal amount of potato \"piped\" onto the top of the contents with each piping being 1/4\" in diameter and ~1\" apart giving a minimal amount of potato in the overall dish. there was no evidence of any cheese anywhere. the lamb \\'stew\\' underneath was bland with a gelatinous consistency one would expect from a can.\\n\\ni understand \\'chefs\\' want to create their own versions of food and often appreciate when they do. but, if you\\'re going to do so, change the name to indicate it\\'s not the standard dish that is served and appreciated the world over. not doing so disappoints those who simply want to experience the comfort food of their youth., i feel sad that this place went downhill. i used to count on the food being good. i had their shrimp tacos last time i went and they were those mini baby shrimp that come in the can. so. bad. seafood flavored pieces of chalk., i usually don\\'t leave yelp reviews, but this one really called for it. after looking at everyone\\'s negative reviews, i thought i could still give it a try. that was a mistake. the food was barely edible and far too overpriced for what it was. i got the senzo bean taco and it was not presentable or edible in any way. there was also hardly any food on my plate when it was served. if you are there just for drinks, i would recommend it. the food is itself just not worth it., i\\'d like to give a detailed review for this business but i\\'m afraid i cannot as i only have one extremely short experience. we walked into the establishment on july 3rd, looking to sit down for dinner around 7:30 pm. there was no one to greet us for at least 5 mins. finally someone greeted us and we asked for a table. she then proceed to informed us that there is no table available despite the fact that we can see open spaces at the bar and that their advertised balcony is empty. we were not looking to participate or interrupt in their trivia night if that was the point in turning us away. we also couldn\\'t have cared less if dinner/drinks took long. we were looking to sit down, maybe enjoy the atmosphere and we\\'re extremely disappointed in the way we were turned away with almost no explanation. to be honest, we would probably never try to go again., we were very excited to try pop inn after looking at the decor and descriptions online. the experience fell well short of our expectations. we called ahead and were told they didn\\'t offer reservations after 6, but getting a seat wouldn\\'t be a problem. after a 45 minute wait we were told we could either sit outside to eat or wait longer, we chose to eat outside after being quite hungry from our wait. it took an additional 30 minutes to receive our drinks (they said the bar was busy), so i guess tables aren\\'t prioritized. we had 3 orders of wings and everyone\\'s turned our extremely overdone and dry. i had a shrimp taco entree which was small, and 2 others had burgers which were subpar. i wouldn\\'t recommend getting any of their \"ice ball\" alcoholic drinks as the whole thing is basically ice. i expected a larger glass to accommodate the larger ice portion, but this was not the case. all in all we won\\'t be headed back as we had a very long wait to be seated and receive our drinks, and didn\\'t even get to enjoy the pop culture asthetic, which is the whole point., i\\'m gonna only go 2 stars. \\nmy co-workers and i went on our lunch break, not knowing what to expect. \\nthe waitress and staff was friendly, however it took longer than expected, especially at lunch time for our food to be served. the fries that my coworker ordered came out cold.  \\ni ordered the chili over pasta.  well, it was more like chili soup & i had to hunt for what very little pasta there was underneath.  \\nfirst & last visit., my family and i placed a to-go order this past friday. we got two orders of wings (garlic parm and buffalo), a grilled cheese with tomato and a side of the tomato soup, and the original mac n cheese. the wings were okay, but had very little meat on them. i also requested two orders of ranch and was given two blue cheese dressings, which someone in my family has an allergy too. luckily i noticed the difference before disaster could have struck but still was not a good start to the meal. the grilled cheese was good but it was cold and the tomato soup was not included in the order. the mac n cheese was probably the worst part of the meal. the flavor was overwhelming and not in a good way. it made kraft mac n cheese look like it should be served at a 5-star restaurant in comparison. when i went to get the food the inside seemed like a nice ambiance, but it\\'s unlikely i\\'ll be returning anytime soon., ordered from the bar a mike\\'s hard lemonade and a beer. the bartender tried to sell us another type of hard lemonade. why?  he said i have to go in the back and get the mikes lemonade. lazy.  he did go back and get the mike\\'s hard. ordered a beer barely cold. i asked for ice for my beer. do you think the bartender would say, \"hey is your beer cold enough \". nope. ordered wings, just ok. the poor servers had to use a flashlight to look in a cooler by the bar. place inside looks like a garage sale., this place has a huge identity problem. you walk in and there is a bar decorated with kid masks/toys/etc. in the dining area, forty year old virgin was playing on the tv.  kids were running around freely while parents sipped on cocktails. and by freely, i meant totally disappearing from the dining room and running through the bar. at the bar, some long haired guy who was in need of a shower was trying to pick up these two young ladies. the bartender seemed to be trying to help the creepy guy by heavy pouring for the young ladies. i really felt like i was in an bizarre universe. the food sounds interesting, creative. but the \"let\\'s cuddle and eat tacos\" were so disappointing. promising crunch, it was a soggy mess and i bit on something hard, probably from the meat mixture. that didn\\'t really bother me because it\\'s a thing and i\\'ve experienced that at other places when i eat something with ground meat. my partner had the miss piggy (pulled pork and mac n cheese). disappointing. there are several other local places that do pork and man n cheese so perhaps those places just do it better? (i don\\'t want to name them because i don\\'t want to be accused of soliciting!). the cocktails are way over priced and i wondered if they had any actual alcohol in them? so perhaps i wasn\\'t pretty/young enough to equate a heavy pour like the young ladies at the bar. by the way, the young ladies left together and the bartender looked at the creepy guy and shrugged his shoulders. if you are a parent that doesn\\'t want their children exposed to movies like forty year old virgin, i\\'d skip this place. if you want to feel what it might be like to live inside a schizophrenics mind, then give this a try., this was a disappointment to say the least.  the service was lousy as we had a server who appeared to be extremely disinterested as well as unfocused.  perhaps management should consider training their servers!  10 wing appetizer was actually 8 wings...math is an important skill.  although the tacos didn\\'t taste bad, they came out as 3 shells that you had to spread the meat contents in to each shell.  the burger wasn\\'t bad just put together w/o thought & side salad was warm...warm salad isn\\'t very good, same w/ the pickles.  \\nthe place is very visually busy including the menu!  it\\'s extremely loud & wasn\\'t the cleanest looking of places.  \\nback to the lousy server who wasn\\'t attentive & took forever to get our draft beers...i had to finally get up walk toward the bar & when i found him i asked if he forgot our drinks?  with an attitude tells me he\\'s getting them now & mumbles the system went down...we waited an additional 15 more minutes & by that time we were done!  as he drops the beers off to us i explained it would\\'ve be nice had he let us know there was an issue & it would be a bit...he looks annoyed then stayed \" i can\\'t help it if the bar is crowded.\"  so which is it the system going downs fault? the crowded bars fault? or perhaps the lazy servers fault? \\ncongratulations it\\'s a 1st for me to pay the bill w/o leaving a tip!, not impressed... interior was cold, busy and loud... burger temperature was rare when asked for medium. they remade it for us, then it came out well done... tacos were greasy and not flavorful, no better than taco bell...service was nice..., worst place ever the bartender that thinks he\\'s cool with his little goatee that tells people this is an a bus stop when they\\'re waiting for their friends only for 10 minutes the food is trash i\\'ve ordered from here multiple times they do not know how to cook a simple burger the place is dirty the one girl i know that works there says the kitchen is disgusting and there\\'s bugs all back there and the owners do nothing about it because all they focus on is all the stupid kid toys because they\\'re a bunch of children running a restaurant when he should\\'ve opened a video game store definitely do not recommend stay away far away go to nico\\'s five minutes up the road they have really good pizza and their staff are super friendly and you can sit in there as long as you would like and they don\\'t harass you and make you feel like crap for waiting for friends just because you got somewhere early he was acting like i was taking up seating when the place was dead like it always is the only people that go there are old people and the handful of regulars that have no life and just sit at a bar all day slowly drinking themselves to death i\\'m going to order a burger next time and take a picture of it to post it so you can see how crappy the food is just to prove a point whoever is cooking over there as no idea what they\\'re doing, if you love getting hosed this is the place for you. owner tried a bait and switch. not cool., wings were so dry (barely any sauce) but worse than that, they were so heavily salted it was difficult to eat. we are salt lovers too so this was a first to have something be \"too salty\". not a fan of these wings at all., it was our son\\'s birthday and he loves comics so we thought this would be a great place to celebrate....we couldn\\'t have been more wrong.\\nwe were a party of 6 and our server was very attentive and nice.  we were seated inside in the back.\\nwe ordered 2 orders of wings and the spinach dip as appetizers.  the wings were ok, the spinach dip was good.\\nfor our main meals we chose, cheesesteak and fries, fried fish tacos, chicken nuggets, mac and cheese with pulled pork, fried chicken tacos, and beef and dorito tacos.\\neverything was awful - the mac and cheese was stouffers with pulled pork you would get out of a microwave tin.  the nuggets were overcooked so much that you couldn\\'t really chew them.  the tacos we ordered were no better.  there was nothing fresh or house made in them.  none of us ate our meals, we left them pretty much as they were served to us.  we all agreed you could get better food at a school lunch.\\nwe spent $120 for food that was inedible - save your money and skip this place., i thought i was entering the bedroom of sheldon cooper from big bang theory.\\nsuggest you get a different recipe for the lobster roll not very good. suggest you change menu for more adult selections. citizens bank park has better options.\\ndisappointing.. we live in walking distance...doubt if we return\\nthank goodness for the new britain inn, oh geez -- where to begin with this place. it\\'s got to be the location and/or the building because nothing seems to work out for very long on the corner of routes 152 & 202. \\n\\nas you walk in you are greeted by the obvious comic book/video game theme throughout the joint. the bar area is nice as is the back dining area. however, the service leaves a lot to be desired. the pours off of the draught taps are usually short and not well managed. the cocktails are, also, not up to par. the menu is very interesting ... and if only the food served was actually as good as it read on the menu.  the food (for lack of other words) is meh at best. \\n\\nwhere i\\'m going with this is: if you need a local spot to meet friends then this will do or go for the trivia night. besides that i would recommend going into montgomeryville or doylestown. i want to like this spot and it is just not happening. in the immortal words of mortal kombat: fatality!, i wanted to like this place because it was close to home and had decent reviews.   i\\'m being generous with 2 stars because there was a decent beer selection.    we were very impressed with the decor i. libby and bar area.  upon arrival it did not look crowded so i was surprised when we were told there would be about a 5 minute wait and directed to bar.   before we could order drinks hostess came over to say table was ready.  \\nwe walked into dining room and were again impressed with decor.  there were at least 4 empty tables and hostess wanted to seat us in corner that was a table for two next to a table that had already seated 10 with 2 high chairs.   seriously?!  i asked for a different table.  \\ni can\\'t fault the restaurant when patrons can not control their kids but i feel they could have directed us to a more quiet section.  parents let their kids climb out of high chairs or play/run around while they drank their beers and martinis.   however the acoustics made everything sound loud.  i really wanted to leave but knew my husband was hungry. \\nappetizer of chicken and waffles was disappointing.  waffle had little flavor and chicken tasted like overcooked tyson\\'s.  bbq sauce had taste.  honey mustard bore no resemble you it\\'s name.   hubby ordered pork tacos.  presentation plain - three tacos no additional sauce or chips.   i ordered fish and chips.  fish, sauce and slaw very tasty.  chips were greasy french fries. \\nbill was $60.   i guess a fair price for quantity (including 4 beers) but quality of food served was overpriced. \\nagain.  i really wanted to like this place.  the concept/decor is great and outside signs are clever and  inviting but once seated at a table goes straight to disappointment., staff was rude .. we simply asked for toddler high chairs..chairs were old and could not get the straps to work.. staff was not helpful  ....we left and went to the new britain inn (nbi)   a real shame.. we can walk there..never again\\n\\nthe nbi is terrific\\n\\nmissing borghi\\'s.. but he has a place in stone harbor and the food is spectacular, was here twice -- first for a nightcap at the bar -- the drinks really were some good stuff and i tried a the lemon hummus and pita -- that was the best hummus ive ever had!\\n\\nthe next morning we came in for brunch, which was pretty much terrible. first of all, it took us 45 minutes to get our food for brunch....and it came out cold and we found a hair. the manager did comp our check though. overall, the bar is great, but i would skip breakfast. what a disappointment for a kimpton restaurant., happen upon this location in search of a post new year eve breakfast.  even w/o reservations we were seated almost immediately. party of 4 ordered pancakes, eggs and frittata all which were good, problem was the service. two in our party received their food the other two did not. nothing worse than half the table getting their food while the others have to wait!!!  folks w/o food say \" go ahead, don\\'t wait\". in my opinion this is just about the worst thing a restaurant could do to a guest.  despite the food being good the type of service we received during our visit caused us to have a poor dining experience.  unfortunately we left the location vowing never to return.  please 1682 work on this issue, it\\'s important and has a huge impact on the customer experience. food get 4 stars, service gets 1., this place is incredibly pricey $14 for a moscow mule? especially one that was very week just tastes like ginger beer it was not enjoyable at all. our bartender was nice but he kept touching his hair and then proceeded to grab ice with his bare hands and put that in customers glasses (really!) total disappointment especially because we love this hotel!!!, listen, i hate to be the bearer of bad news, but excuse me hotel palomar...banners are for science museums and the like...not for kimpton hotels. \\n\\nrewind...\\n\\ni was walking to a little meeting down 17th street and i look up and in my face i see \"hotel palomar\" on a plastic banner vertically hanging from the hotel. ew. guess what hotel palomar? people know you\\'re there...or at the least the people who you want in your establishment know you are there! this isn\\'t like \"the human body\" at the franklin institute. how many hotels have you seen with a plastic banner? probably zero (unless you include the days inn in portland maine, but honestly...) \\n\\nugh. it made me so angry that i had to give it a demerit. maybe they need a new marketing director. \\n\\nxo, i have debated posting this review since mother\\'s day ( month ago). i want to be fair, but gnawing at my gut is the overall poor food experience i had there. \\n\\nof course i wanted something special for my mother on this day, so i gathered my siblings and their families and selected 3 places to attempt to get reservations. one was at the william penn inn, the other route 6. i scoured the reviews and menus and decided square 1682 was the best option. \\n\\nsquare was super accommodating  with my large party of 12 and the customer service was outstanding. i canceled the reservation with the two other places and banked on square delivering a great day. that was a mistake. \\n\\npositive: the manager, staff, hostess, waitresses were super sweet. \\n\\nthe mimosas were the best think i consumed that dining experience\\n\\ntwo  items were comped\\n \\ncon\\'s:\\ntwo of our orders were mixed up ( another waitress took the ticket), so 10 of us ate while two of us watched. the late food arrived about 15 mins later. \\n\\nthe prime rib sandwich was skimpy, grossly over cooked, and barely edible. i have had a lot of prime rib in my life, this was thin and crunchy. it was served with a tiny bit of sauce on a firm fancy roll. my mother ordered the same and the disappointment on her face was awful. the others at the table had a variety of underwhelming dishes. no one was satisfied, but everyone was polite. i was crushed. \\n\\nthere were a total of 5 mothers in that bunch and there was absolutely nothing special about it.  it was a nice room, the staff was nice, but it was one of the worst dining experiences i have had in philly.\\n\\ni really regret booking this place. we spent hundreds of dollars and everyone left a little quiet and disappointed. as a matter of fact my mother later confided she was starving after we left. \\n\\ni understand holiday restaurant service is maddening, but imo this place was not properly staffed, nor prepared to handle providing good food on a special day. i would never recommend someone come to this establishment. i wish i had chose one of the other places. \\n\\nnext year i\\'m #teamsomewhereelse! i don\\'t mind paying the money, if i leave with a smile on my face. \\n\\nno smiley face here...., my gf and i were told by the hostess that they were open until 2am. we ordered fries then after they were put in and given to us, we were told they were having a bar clean. the bartender just came around and announced last call at 11:43pm. no sign was posted on the door, nor was it locked preventing any customers from entering. needless to say that this will be the last time we visit this bar for drinks. horrible notice. anyone visiting might want to call to verify when the next \"bar clean\" will be. the bartender was very rude to customers who arrived after last call, rolling her eyes after an order and seeming to be disgusted when two women arrived., unfortunately a sad disappointment for a sunday brunch. first time here after hearing this was a great place to come to enjoy a sunday morning. the option to sit outside, sounded amazing however, we were left neglected. waiting for along time for drinks, (approx. a 1/2 hour) food and service. for the price, atmosphere and service was not worth the effort to plan a sunday here. let alone, when leaving the restaurant was bare inside. not sure, with the excuse they were short staffed by the server, where everyone was during our dining experience, not even apologetic nor a manger to come to check on the experience. next sunday, will be dining and recommending other options for a sunday brunch., poor experience for sunday brunch. staying at palomar hotel, so arrived early, at 800 a.m., and restaurant was empty. still had 3 different waiters and had to wait 10 minutes for a coffee refill. green eggs and ham omelette was good, but was presented with huge portion of greasy home fries that dwarfed the omelette, and not even a piece of toast. my wife ordered the yogurt parfait, which was good. but bagel was bready and oversized. philly has good bagels; square 1682 does not. if this restaurant focused on food quality instead of volume, and hired more staff, might be a good experience. currently, is a very disappointing brunch experience., i stopped in for happy hour, and i ordered their happy hour cocktail. the bartender described the new drink to one of the curious kitchen staff. right before he served it to me, he offered her a straw-full of my drink out of my glass. the bartender told her \"just put your finger over the straw and take some out.\" she wisely declined and tasted the leftover still in the shaker. completely unprofessional.\\n\\nalso, a businessman/guest came back to question a surcharge on a drink. he was told it was because the whisky was neat. not the best policy, but ok. but afterwards the bartenders mocked the fact that he returned to question such a small amount, \"it\\'s not like it was even that much.\" this was in front of me and another customer.\\n\\nthe cocktail was great and the food on the menu looked good. i just couldn\\'t bear to be around this one bartender anymore., why oh why would you put us upstairs in the creepy 2nd floor when the downstairs is so cool?\\n\\nwhy would it take 20 minutes to make a yogurt parfait?\\n\\nthese are the questions of square 1682 that demand to be answered, went here for breakfast. food was good, but pricey for what it is. the waitress was terrible and barely came to our table...we had to ask other waitresses for things we needed., we expected much more from this restaurant after reviewing the menu and reviews online. upon our arrival despite having reservations, it took a good 15 minutes to be seated. after being seated, it took another 15 minutes to get any type of service. when we finally received our entrees, mine was burnt and bland, and was not prepared as requested. we definitely will not return to this place., i thought i\\'d love this place, but i was wrong!  my partner and i had brunch today with his youngest sister.  we had a great time catching up and spending time together, but i didn\\'t care for the food/service at all.  the service at best was slow.  maybe i\\'m being too picky, but i ordered an iced coffee .... i like kimpton\\'s.  i think their nice.  nicer than a dd\\'s, right?  they put the milk in it!  um, do you know how i like my iced coffee?  no.  just bring me some milk with my ic!  whatever, i got over it....  i had the huevos rancheros and it was bland, bland, bland!!!  just not a good experience.  i may try it one more time, but def not for brunch., had a breakfast here (as kimpton guests), which was the worst hotel breakfast we\\'ve experienced ever. \\nas we walked in no any kind of greetings or smile, just a  sit where you want gesture.\\n\\nhad: a) beet me (a small glass of supposedly beet, carrot, ginger and cilantro raw juice, which in reality was filled with 2 huge cylinders of ice taking the 2/3 of the space in a glass and the rest of the space was filled with undrinkable mess of awfully tasted beet and ginger juice with nowhere found carrot or cilantro flavor). and this is coming from the person who loves raw juices and familiar with many flavors of them. otherwise why would i ordered this mess for the price of the $9 ?!?! for this??? \\n         b) supermarket quality bagel and croissant with the slice of philadelphia cream cheese bought in some of those warehouses (like bj\\'s or sam\\'s, no condiments like jams or jellies coming with them) for $4 each?!\\n         c) 2 cups of not good tasting coffee (no milk until asked, no refills offered) for $4 each?!\\n\\nand then comes the question from the waitress \"how did you like it?\"\\nwell, she received our honest opinion about how we liked it, and after hearing it, said with of course an attitude: \"if you didn\\'t like it you don\\'t have to pay for it\", which actually was the only positive (and i would say fare) part of our experience in this place. paying about $30 for a minimal breakfast for 2 should include much more hospitality, taste and satisfaction than was offered to us here., this is probably the worst restaurant i\\'ve ever been to. the food was sub par and everything was expensive and not fresh at all. my girlfriend ordered a steak medium rare, when the steak came it was super cold and cooked way more than she wanted it. i asked them to give her a new steak and their first reaction was, \" we can warm it up\". and i finally demanded a new steak to be ordered. when that steak came the second time, it was just as cold. the steak was not even steaming or anything. first of all, whenever you order a steak, it should be steaming coming right off the grill and it was anything but that. absolutely terrible restaurant. please save yourself the trouble and just avoid this place at all costs., what a joke!  first of let me say i am a graphic artist so i am temperamentally open to the idea of \"food as art\" but the food has better totally rock if they\\'re going to give you tiny little portions like they are all that.  got a multi course tasting menu on a groupon or something for $60 a couple.  first course two skinny little slices of beet with about a 1/4 tsp of goat cheese in the middle...beet napolean!  two other similar courses not really even that special taste wise and a total ego ride rip off.  fourth course was so flooded with that pre-chopped garlic you can buy at the acme that, that was all i tasted until two days later.  check came and they had added a tip of 20% to the \"actual value\" of $145 adding another $30 to our check.  this was a rip off at the price we paid for the coupon.  at $145 they\\'d have had a revolution on their hands.  please don\\'t go there and support this guy.  better off anywhere else., had a business event in philadelphia this past sunday and monday and decided to stay at the hotel palomar near rittenhouse square.\\n\\nthe hotel itself was fine.  nice staff, clean room and being it\\'s a boutique hotel. it doesn\\'t take a hike to get from the elevator to your hotel room.  \\n\\nwhat will keep me from staying at the palomar philadelphia in the future is square 1682.  while the staff is more than nice, the food itself was horrid, and just one waiter working during monday breakfast ( ~ 8 am) made a coffee refill wishful thinking.\\n\\nlet me take a step back.\\n\\ni arrived at the hotel palomar on sunday around 1 pm, checked in and came downstairs for a quick bite to eat before heading to the convention center.\\n\\nthe menu was somewhat sparse being a brunch menu with a handful of lunch items.  i ordered a vegetable frittata (hold the cheese) with the house potatoes.  oddly, the frittata did not come with toast, which is a bit odd for an egg entree.\\n\\nhowever, the no toast wasn\\'t the issue.  what was an issue was that the frittata came with a coat of grease over the top.  because i was absolutely famished and had to get to meetings, i woofed it down.  the house potatoes on the other hand were simply inedible.  they were cold and laden in salt.  i took 3 bites and left the majority of the potatoes over.\\n\\nthe next morning i decided to play it safe and order 2 poached eggs, a toasted english muffin and instead of the potatoes, asked for a side of fruit.  i\\'m happy to say that my eggs were cooked to order (which is the only reason i\\'m giving this review 2 stars instead of 1).  as i previously mentioned, one waiter on duty for a monday breakfast meant that service, while very friendly, was lacking.\\n\\nmy reason for choosing the hotel palomar over other hotels in the area was due to the very good reviews i read about square 1682 online.  this includes the fact that they were the winner of the 2012 open table diners choice notation.\\n\\nthis frequent traveler isn\\'t quite sure how., waaay overpriced, seriously mediocre, sad little place that takes itself way too seriously.  the decor is nice, but the food is bland (surprising, given how much they market their chef).  everything is expensive, and even the chocolate desserts are bland (how do you screw up chocolate??).  with so many good restaurants in the area, i wouldn\\'t recommend eating here even if you\\'re staying in the hotel., horrible food and service. first off, they served our food 30/40 minutes late. so we were just sitting around until 30 minutes past they realize that they still hadn\\'t even served us the popcorn appetizer. anyways, the meals were horrible-not at all as described on the menu. the dessert afterwards (cookie and cappucino) were aweful. cookie did not taste like a homemade cookie but a chunk of goo, and the cappucino was served in a tall mug and burning hot., the food was fine and the service was acceptable but the front of house service was terrible. while having a coffee at the restaurant during the day (i was staying at the hotel), i informed the manager, john, i was planning on bringing a group of 8 later that evening - he enthusiastically told me he was looking forward to it and we agreed on an area off to the side large enough to accommodate us where he said he would put reserved signs. \\n\\ntwo of us showed up at 7:30pm and three more, including myself, at 7:40pm and the area we agreed upon was seated with two separate families. as we waited at the bar, i thought nothing of the occupied tables beyond they must be taking longer than he expected. cut to 20 minutes later as two more of our party shows up as one of the tables is just getting their food. i asked john about it and he told me the folks at that tabled showed up right before we got there and that was it, no apology, no mention of the reserved signs or any sort of attempt to rectify the situation. \\n\\nseven of us squeezed into a small area and ordered apps as we waited for the table to finally clear out 45 mins later. the waitress was sweet and understanding but we didn\\'t get as much as an apology nor the slightest acknowledgment from the manager that he didn\\'t follow through on what he said. \\n\\nsad. \\n\\nalso: i made a reservation on open table that was cancelled 1 hr after we arrived for some reason - i can only imagine it was so that i didn\\'t leave a review similar to the above., i really wanted to like this restaurant so i gave it two tries.  me thinks this was two tries too many.  on my first visit i selected two veggie side dishes:  roasted brussel sprouts and the braised collard greens  and the chicken leg and thigh confit as the entree.  the basic prep for both veggies was the same: bacon and some kraut.  the brussel sprouts were raw and certainly not roasted.  the chicken leg and thigh confit dish was a disaster:  the base for this was a biscuit cut in two.  the dry and overcooked pressed chicken was put on top and covered in the \"thyme\" reduction.  i cannot say i tasted thyme.  the sauce was far too salty and that\\'s all i tasted.  no one seemed to care that i barely touched the chicken dish.  \\non my second trip i selected the grilled asparagus and selected the halibut on yucca \"frites.\"  the asparagus were very tiny - again tasted like they were cooked using the same sauce/spices as the asparagus/collard greens.  the halibut was tiny, tiny, tiny - likely 2-oz cooked and it was overcooked.  the best part of the dish were the yucca frites.  service annoyed me no end on this visit because the couple seated to my left were newlyweds.  the server fawned over them and completely ignored me.  if you want great food and service don\\'t waste your time or money here go two doors down to davios.  i promise you will have a terrific experience!, service here is the worst. we waited forever for a server to take our order when there are about 10 people standing around doing absolutely nothing. after we proceeded to finish our food the manager kept looking over at our table while we patiently waited for our check but did absolutely nothing to help his staff out and check us out. we came to this restaurant because we were staying at the hotel but this was clearly a mistake., just got back from having brunch at square 1682. the bartender on during brunch was probably one of the worst i\\'ve ever come across. sat down with friends who had arrived earlier and waited a full 10 minutes before the bartender even acknowledged my presence, and there were exactly two other people at the bar! when our table was finally ready, it took another ten minutes for the bartender to finally re-appear so we could settle our bar check and take our table. the food was very good, my friends had the \\'cheesesteak\\' and i had the eggs cochon, both were very good. service at the table was acceptable, but the waiter did seem to vanish for long periods of time, an all to common problem at this establishment.\\n\\nbrunch food here is good, but next time we\\'ll go somewhere that has better service than this slipshod operation., i wish that restaurants understood the importance of good customer service, square 1682 does not. last month i dined here for my boyfriend\\'s birthday dinner and upon clearing our dinner plates, the assistant manager dropped a piece of truffle duck egg from my dinner plate onto my boot, ruining the leather boot.  he apologized and brought club soda but did not offer to comp our dinner or reimburse me for the expensive pair of boots. he ruined my boots and all i got was club soda.\\n\\nmy boyfriend called shortly after and asked to speak with a manager.  the manager said he would send us an \"incident report\" to complete and see what he could do about offering some form of reimbursement. he said he would call back and email us the form, he did not do either. my boyfriend has since called 3 times and every time the \"manager is not available, i\\'ll have them call you\" but not a single person has been able to assist us, send us the form, or call us back to explain why we are being ignored.\\n\\ni wish i could write a nice review of the food and ambiance of this place but i will not be doing that until i hear back from the manager.  if i hear back from them soon then i\\'ll be back to update my review.  until then, avoid this place and go to r2l., terrible service all around. the tables are oddly set up - you either have a high top or you\\'re sitting on a makeshift parisienne café mini table. the hostess was rude, the waitress had no clue about the drink menu and served my fiancé a manhattan without asking for a preference on or off the rocks. giving it three stars because we decided not to stay and eat., i dined here on restaurant week with a friend. so for our appetizers we ordered the charred octopus w/braised white beans, garlic, spinach and the dipping trio: hummus, baba ganoush, almond red pepper, spread, and toasted breads. the octopus tasted fishy and not fresh. for our main courses we chose the pan roasted shrimp with\\nancho chili romesco, handmade spinach fettuccini, soubise & pork tenderloin\\nbutternut squash risotto, apple chutney, demi glace. everything on my shrimp dinner tasted like garlic, the shrimp were tiny and the fettuccini - tasteless. my friends\\'s risotto was undercooked and the pork tenderlion was forgettable. dessert time...we both ordered the french pear tart almond pastry cream pear bourbon sorbet. finally, i can say i enjoyed something - the pear bourbon sorbet - cause the tart was surely popped out of a box and plopped on our plates. overall i wonder if they were just offering substandard menu choices because it was restaurant week & we were only paying restaurant week prices. hope not, rw is a great way to find permanent spots to dine at. but this experience soured me on square 1682. we won\\'t be returning., do not get the shrimp and grits on the brunch menu.  it was tasteless and watery. i dumped an entire cup of hot sauce in it just to add some flavor.\\n\\nmy friend ordered the frittata, which was made pretty decently, so if you must go there for brunch, stick to that instead., walked out after sitting in a virtually empty restaurant without service for nearly 10 minutes. i finally flagged down a waiter who came up to the table and asked \"what do you need?\" rudely. ahhh how about a menu? service? politeness? we realized then what we needed was to leave that god awful place and find somewhere else to brunch (we went to devon\\'s)--not a great intro to the  philly brunch scene., i wanted to like this place, i really did but i left unfulfilled and a little sad.\\n\\ni received a $25 dining credit that was included in the reservation package while staying at hotel palomar and thought it only appropriate to use it for breakfast. \\n\\ni rated this 2 stars, because i absolutely loved the decor of the restaurant. we were seated at a table upstairs, where they had a chalkboard wall behind the serving station, funky brightly colored chairs and booths, and had what looked like swing arm desk lamps mounted upside-down on the walls, pointing upwards at the cork-tiled ceiling.\\n\\nhowever, the decor aside, i did not enjoy my breakfast here. the menu does grab your attention with items such as creme brulee french toast, mississippi blueberry griddlecakes, shrimp and grits, and eggs cochon de laut (which is what i ordered). essentially, all the right ingredients were there: eggs, buttermilk biscuits, shredded pork confit, mushroom ragout, and bourbon-bacon hollandaise. my mouth was watering at the thought of all these delicious items combined. plus, i was starving.\\n\\nwhat was placed in front of me was much smaller than i had envisioned. but the worst part was how it tasted. all those delectable ingredients didn\\'t mean a thing; as a matter of fact i forgot they were even there. the entire dish tasted somewhat burnt (as in someone had severely burnt something in a pot, dumped it out, and then cooked my breakfast in that uncleaned pot). to top it off, because the eggs were poached, my breakfast became a slimy, burnt-tasting $12 mess. it was the most disappointing meal i\\'d had in a while., went here for restaurant week...nothing big stood out the food was average at best and the wait staff was not too attentive...the place was not packed...would not go back..., between 1.5-2 stars.  \\n\\npretty disappointing food and the service was lacking.  sorry.  \\n\\nthe menu is very diverse and ambitious but our dishes were lacking.  some of them were just basic cooking problems.  other than that, it was just bland.    \\nwe ordered as appetizers mussels, grits, and some type of sauteed chard.  the grits and chard were fine although i would have used less garlic.  some of the mussels were undercooked, which means they are slimy and elastic.  the chorizo and broth was good but pretty basic. \\nfor a main course we had roasted chicken with beets, and snapper with purple potato mash.  the chicken was...a roasted chicken (it was fine, should have been better).  the snapper was a bit over salted, and the skin wasn\\'t crispy as it should have been.  the purple mash was real letdown, it was very thick.  i\\'m not food scientist but my understanding is that happens when they are overwhipped or there is too much starch still in it (undercooked?).  it also came with some sauteed cherry tomatoes that i think were intended to be burst, but they weren\\'t cooked long enough to burst, and were still cold inside (unappetizing).  \\n\\ni know this sounds like nit-picking but the snapper was $26.  that\\'s a lot of money.       \\n\\nfrom start to finish it took almost 2 hours, which is too long., i had a terrible experience while dining during restaurant week. the service was extremely poor as the restaurant was not busy. the portions were very small and presentation was definitely in the gutter. the waitress was unprofessional, using inappropriate language and making rude comments. hours after leaving the restaurant i was accosted by the waitress, her sister and kitchen staff. uwtqiyqiitiee3qieeiytqiewww1eqe1 q qwwwqeyeiquteqerettwqewtqywqwwqqww11qeetq rw rwyoiiiueqeqqrwrwwqqqouiqeyoqtrriqeuqqqpwur3, wife and i went on a travelzoo voucher.  starter, two entrees, dessert, bottle of chardonnay:  $79.  duck wings app was great.  meaty, nice sauce.  wife\\'s swordfish entree was way overcooked.  cat food.  my culotte steak was ordered medium.  came out cold and red in the center:  beware:  room service and takeout orders have a higher priority than the restaurant diners.  your food takes third place.  p.s.  service was great.  no problems there., we had brunch here one morning while staying at the hotel... and it was just mediocre. nice setup and presentation, but the food was just bland and not worth the price. even the coffee was bad and watered down. our waitress was inattentive and slightly rude, i don\\'t think she smiled once at us, although it was a very quiet morning and the restaurant was mainly empty. oh and they ask you if you would like some fresh juice as soon as you sit down, with a pitcher in their hand, but fail to mention it\\'s $4/5 for a small glass on your tab., food may have been good, but the group of 16 seated nearby was so loud it distracted from everything else., review for happy hour only: i know my way around the restaurant scene and this place was the worst ever!!! the service was horrendous!! so much so that we left after one drink. i love my $5 wine as much as the next person but this is the worst service i have ever experienced in a long time. we got there around 5:30 on thurs and no one took our order for ten minutes so then the bartender from the bar shouted across the bar \\'what would u like\\' and i had to go to the bar to get the menu. then i ordered and had to get up and walk to the bar to get my drink?!? but i could even put up with all this but it was just the manner in which the bartender was clearly not serving any of his customers.  i promptly asked my check and went to noble for their awesome happy hour and vowed to never go back to square 1682., the lunch menu had a lot of options that appeared tasty to choose from. however, the overall flavor of the dishes i tried coupled with the 2 hours it took for a lunch make this a not so great spot to try again on a workday or perhaps altogether.\\n\\ni have to say the only highlights of the meal were the french fries with a wonderful spicy dipping sauce and the homemade ice cream that accompanied the desserts. the remainder of the food was forgettable and largely unsatisfactory. the chilled melon gazpacho soup was ok but room temperature and unfortunately over-blended (unfortunate it was blended at all in my opinion). the it\\'s always sunny chicken sandwich (love the name) was super dry but at least had those great french fries. i\\'m not entirely sure how a lump of fried chicken topped with a fried egg ends up \"dry\" but that\\'s the report i got so avoid it even if pulled in by the cute name. the ginger steamed cod was absolutely, positively lacking in any distinct flavor. i had really hoped that after the 1hr wait for our food it would be gingery and lovely but it was bland lukewarm water surrounding a stack of bland and unseasoned veggies topped with a piece of cod. extremely disappointing.\\n\\nthere were however, a few positive notes to the lunch. the waiter was very nice and helpful although spent much of the meal arguing with the kitchen staff to get our orders (as he told us). the zucchini wrapped goat cheese appetizer went over well. the beef short rib sandwich made one diner quite pleased (although they seemed more excited before it arrived and took it apart during eating and left parts on the plate so...). the apple tart was pretty good too. this may be a nice spot for a couple of drinks and some wonderful homemade ice cream (particularly the cinnamon ice cream). however, i think this was probably my one and only visit to this establishment., we heard about their byod (bring your own dog) brunch for sat and sun and had to come in for a visit. for those pet owners who can\\'t go anywhere without their animals, then this was a must as they serve small dog size portion brunch options. \\n\\nwe brought our little yorkie and attempted to come in for brunch on saturday at 1030. outside patio seating was empty so we expected to be seated quickly. when we checked in, the hostess told us they were too busy that we needed to wait 25 minutes to even be seated. apparently the manager told her not to seat any new parties as the kitchen was busy and needed to catch up.  this was the first time i\\'ve ever heard this from any restaurant and was shocked. we could\\'ve just sat, looked through the menu and been happy waiting, but we weren\\'t too happy to just stand around and wait outside doing nothing. we just took our business elsewhere \\n\\nwill we come back and try again next time? maybe...if we do, then i can update my review but for now, this is what my rating will be, if i could give no stars i would have.  so disappointing.  we there for lunch for the first time last week for restaurant week. the hostess seemed almost surprised that someone walked in the door. the waitress was nice and the food was just ok. desserts were terrible!  the chocolate peanut butter mousse was edible at most.  the orange cream cake can only be described as and old corn muffin with something that resembles ranch dressing and some peaches on it. it was so hard we needed to use a knife to break it. \\nwe came back today for happy hour and were  determined to give the place another chance.  boy, did we regret it. once again,  the hostess was surprised that someone walked in and almost seemed annoyed by people walking in.  the waitress couldn\\'t be more rude.  after we ordered drinks, she took away our drink menu. call me crazy,  but i was hoping to have more than one drink tonight.  when we asked her to keep the menu on the table,  she rolled her eyes and came back with all the menus they have dropped them on our table and mumbled something about here are all the menus we have... on top of that, she never smiled, never made eye contact and didn\\'t look happy to be there. food sucked! calamari was soggy,  deviled eggs were bland and the bacon wrapped dates were burned and dry. the drink was so boring i just couldn\\'t bring myself to order another. please go somewhere else.  there\\'s no hope., 1682 definitely is a trendy space. even the menu sounds trendy. however, the food itself doesn\\'t quite deliver. admittedly i have only been there for the brunch; however, i was appalled at the mediocrity and price of the food (i certainly don\\'t mind paying for great food). \\n\\nthe waffle i ordered seemed to have been reheated or even worse frozen and nuked. ditto for my friend\\'s muffin. \\n\\nalso, for her dish she asked for the pork-based sauce to be held and the server kindly offered an alternative veggie-friendly sauce. however, when my friend\\'s plate arrived, it arrived sans sauce and with two large pieces of ham. ham was not in the description of the item... not to mention that the server should have deduced that my friend was not inclined to eating pork. \\n\\nmaybe i\\'ll give 1682 a try again, but given the plethora of great dining options in the area, i wouldn\\'t bet on it., what the heck is going on here?? the food is good, but the way this place is run is so ridiculous. trying to get lunch and relax a bit and it was a hectic and stressful experience.the chef was sweeping the kitchen floor while food prep and cooking was going on, the food runners had dirty fingernails and one had a dirty bandaged hand. it was obvious from the looks of things that the food runners were overwhelmed and not sure where to go next. the waitress was clueless, usual mistakes, not keeping an eye on the tables for refills of drinks, checking for silverware, following up on orders to be sure guests are getting the proper platters. the kitchen is wide open for all to see what a cluster this place is. all the while, i noticed a quiet manager with her head buried in the corner. for the prices, i expect more attention to detail., so disappointed! we were given a table that felt like a punishment. everything took forever to arrive. the cream container had crusty yellow coating from never being cleaned. all of that is excusable but the food sucked too. i could see what they were tying to do with the menu but everything we had was awful. the only reason they got a star is that our waiter was very nice and tried to be helpful and the decor is interesting., if you want to ruin your mother\\'s day meal, go to this place. it\\'s definitely a bar eatery rather than a restaurant because it has mostly bar height tables. the bathroom is on the second floor of the hotel so don\\'t have an emergency. people who enjoy themselves here must be drunk bc the food is terrible. the unappetizing hush puppy appetizer was a nauseating green color and tasted like the inside of an old couch cushion. the roles were as dry as the deserr and the salad had dead raspberries. the cake in the trifle was also very dry. the hostess kept making trips to the bar for a drink, instead of watching her post. none of the staff noticed that at one point, one of the patrons tossed a dirty diaper up in the air, as she changed her baby inside the restaurant right at the dining table! the odor of wet diaper urine was palpable. the waitress did apologize, when it was brought to their attention. if you use their \"valet\" parking, be prepared to have your car ticketed, when the valet is too slow to take your car to the garage. they will attempt to prevent you from even seeing the ticket. the hotel will pay the $101 ticket but you\\'ll still have the ticket against your license., i was there over the holiday weekend for halloween- sat night. let me just preface by saying we were staying at the hotel where the customer service is amazing.  at the square, not so much. we were not even acknowledged when we arrived. no eye contact, nod, smile.. nothing.  other patrons were waited on prior to us whom arrived after us. this was for both bar service and waitstaff.  we needed to flag down wait staff for menus and request silverware.  it was not a busy night... staff was not knowledgeable and generally unprepared.  there are too many other good restaurants in the area to waste time on poor service., i went to the restaurant with a party of 9 to celebrate a birthday. i was surprised to receive our own private room and the decor was nice. my first impression of the server was that she was nice but honestly, looked unkept. her hair was greasy and she should have pulled it back or something in order to at least try to show a decent representation of the restaurant. the only appetizer i enjoyed was the scallop. the other appetizers were subpar and the chef might enjoy the addition of citrus too much. the chicken wasn\\'t very good and the beef medallion was unimpressive. we bought our own cake and we were told it was a five dollar cutting fee. however, when we received the check, we discovered it was a five dollar cutting fee each person. that means we had to pay $45 to cut the cake! ridiculous! we chose that restaurant and ordered 9 entrees to celebrate a birthday but was treated with such a distasteful action., love the kimpton hotel tried the restaurant for the first time- the most dreadful breakfast in many years- dried out eggs cold potatoes mediocre coffee- very bad and more than 40 dollars for 2 basic breakfast plates- go anywhere else there are many places around that are decent- marathon on the square for one is excellent., went for dinner, sent steak back and still wrong and only got attitude! they try to present as a high end resturaunt with their prices but their cook staff are obviously lacking. ordered a filet medium rare, but it came out well done, literally cooked brown. i asked to redo it, the cook came out with a defensive attitude that here is my steak that needed to be \"less done\". no, i just want it cooked the way i asked in the first place. this time it was raw! less than rare! i sent it back and asked for the menu so i can just order an appetizer. i suggest you do the same or just go someplace else unless you are just going for a drink. \\n\\nat no time did a manager or anyone except the waitress apologize for the steak done wrong twice nor any offer for compensation. steer clear if going for steak, they don\\'t know how to cook it!, this review is for a late morning breakfast, as a guest at the palomar hotel, next store.  we arrived 20 minutes before end of breakfast service, and were the only customers.  so, we waited 5 minutes for a menu, even though plenty of staff visible.  ordered two cappuccinos and a bagel and cream cheese.  after 15 minutes received two, tiny, luke-warm coffees.  another 10 minutes produced a bagel waved near a toaster, and a lump of stone-cold cream cheese on a sad, un-garnished plate.  all this ran $15, but the indifference was free.  next time -- starbucks for sure!, stopped in for cocktails on a date. sat in the bar area (seats to the left of the front door) and waited for what seemed a good 15 minutes before anyone took our drink order. wait staff didn\\'t even make eye-contact with a \\'be right there\\'... nothing. the people at the door were oblivious even though we were trying to make eye contact due to the lack of service. finally when we placed our order, that took another 15 minutes to arrive. no water either, i had to flag them down to ask. awful service. there was no way i was going to order food. won\\'t go back., we tried chicken which was extremely salty that we had to send it back. then we ordered salmon which came half-cocked. food menu is limited and over priced. there are much better choices in downtown philly., if nataly is your waitress, say no thank you and go to a different place. actually, just go to a different place. horrible service from everyone, uncomfortable setting; they made me feel like i was in their way.\\n\\ni have been to square 1682 several times, as i have lived in philadelphia for quite a few years. i\\'ve seen the chef change, menu change, and the interior change. in that time, this past visit to this place was the absolute worst!!! i\\'ve also brought 2 parties of over 20 people, and each of those were able to run efficiently - especially with the rest of the restaurant having other customers. \\n\\nthere is no reason that this past trip for me and my sister should have been any different. our table was not given any attention, we waited forever for water, and even our bar drinks could not be delivered normally. after receiving our water and ordering food, we had to re-ask for our drinks, only to find out that they were never either (1) rang in or (2) made by the bartender who was busy setting up the bar for his shift. in any case, i shouldn\\'t have had to re-ask for much of anything, as there was ample time for nataly to figure out that our drinks were missing.\\n\\nthe only good thing about the visit was that the food tasted good - also, it came out of the kitchen quite efficiently., i dined at square 1682 last saturday with my divorced sister whose a prominent doctor and her 4 kids. while the food was good, it really wasn\\'t anything special. \\n\\nhere\\'s the really bad, incomprehensible part - one in which the waitress should be fired. i truly believe she is in need of major diversity training. it was obvious she thought my sister & i were a gay couple & she treated our whole table poorly while she was nice to other guests dining nearby. \\n\\ni will never, ever dine here again & will tell everyone i know not to dine here either.\\n\\nin this day & age & given the economy you would expect a restaurant to treat guests with the utmost kindness & respect.\\n\\nthumbs down.....way down for this restaurant., food was over-priced and underwhelming. went for lunch based on good reviews and was disappointed. best thing on the table was kids chicken fingers (fresh breaded chicken cutlets). tomato soup and french onion grilled cheese were bland. kids hamburger was tiny and roll was burned. restaurant was freezing. so many good restaurants in this area.- this was a disappointment on a rare family day out. would not return., staying at the palomar for 600 bucks a night, ordered a hamburger and chocolate mouse via room service from square 1682 and they completely forgot my order!  i called back an hour later after the kitchen is closed and they said they can comp my meal for the next day. how the hell is that supposed to help me now? staying late in my room working and trying to prepare for the next day and now i have to go scavenge the streets of philly to try to find a meal., i went for lunch twice now, neither experience was good...square 1682 is not sure what type of restaurant it wants to be.  the menu is a hodge-podge of pretty typical dishes (burger, pulled pork, chicken sandwich) that put unnecessary spins on things that do not add to the dish.  i chose the seasonal soup and chopped salad.  the soup was a weird combination of ingredients, butternut squash and lobster, and was very bland.  the salad was borderline terrible with very blah chicken and shrimp with zero seasoning.  the waitstaff was friendly, but service was very slow and multiple orders at a table of 8 were incorrect.  in a neighborhood with other fantastic options, i will never return to square 1682., i stopped in to square 1682, located at 121 s. 17th st in philadelphia, this morning after attending the 8am mass at the basilica. after passing the hotel and restaurant numerous times on my way home from mass i had the time today to stop, relax and eat. i decided to sit at the bar since i was alone and after asking the bartender several questions about their entrees (sunday\\'s they have an alacarte menu), i decided on the frittata without meat. \\n\\nwhen my food arrived, there were very dark potatoes on the side of the frittata, a circular frittata that was over cooked on the underside of the frittata and rectangular shaped slices of melted swiss cheese on top. the frittata and potatoes barely fit on the small plate used for the entree. i asked if any rolls or toasted bread were going to accompany the meal. although there were no rolls or toasted bread included with the entree, the bartender placed an order for one slice of rye toast at my request.\\n\\n i took three maybe four bites of a very unappetizing and disappointing frittata and the accompanying potatoes. no one ever asked me how i was doing or whether or not i liked the entree. the only question asked me by the bartender was if i wanted to take the frittata and potatoes home with me. i graciously said no thank you and requested the check. \\n\\nthe total cost was $27.22 as i had ordered a mimosa with my entree. the frittata was $14 and the mimosa was $11. i did finish the mimosa however and came directly home to eat breakfast for the second time.\\n\\ni would not recommend the frittata to anyone and as for the service, i would recommend that either the manager or server or bartender, at a minimum, inquire about the satisfaction of the food and beverages. \\n\\ni suppose i could have stated that it was not edible by my standards but i chose not to do that on such a lovely sunday morning. as for the tip...i left a $6 cash tip. i will likely never go there again.\\n\\noverpriced, unappetizing presentation of food and poor communication of staff to the customer., let\\'s talk facts first. fact: this restaurant has a great location and tons of foot traffic. fact: the atmosphere is busy and energetic. fact: the food is very lack luster. when i mean very, i mean very. the lobster pasta was full of tiny bits of chopped up lobster but had absolutely no taste what so ever. literally all i was tasting was mushy overcooked pasta and the aroma of seafood. the brussels sprouts are the weirdest combination i have had. i personally don\\'t go for brussels sprouts in a fondue sauce but i was willing to give it a try. tried and won\\'t be trying again. the strip steak was okay but nothing to save this meal. the best thing i had was the burrata toast so if you go get that. i honestly was hoping this would turn out to be a better first time than it turned out to be. potential is there. maybe with some better flavor combinations and reworking of a few existing dishes this place could be a solid choice for a dinner out., this review is for their easter sunday brunch. it was unfortunately far below expectations for a special sunday brunch. the selections were low quality, poorly prepared, underwhelming. no omelette bar, no smoked fish, no cold seafood buffet. it was far less than whan i expected for $50/person. i can\\'t explain why the brunch was so poorly executed when they do a pretty good job in their regular restaurant., stayed at the hotel on a quick romantic break to philly. we were lazy and decided to eat here as it looked good, the menu was enticing and reviews on the whole positive. in hindsight we should have gone out for dinner. in summary we felt pretty cheated. it was \\'restaurant week\\' and so they had a special prixe fixe menu on. the waiter informed us that portions were \\'slightly smaller\\' and the menu slightly more limited. we decided that sounded ok and forked out $35 each for a very average meal. \\n\\nmy tuna tostadas were very unimpressive....3 tiny little \\'tostadas\\' and some slithers of tuna on some lettuce. my wife\\'s \\'yellow-fin\\' tuna starter was pathetic. 5 minuscule cubes of tuna. she did say it tasted very good, but was gone in about 10 seconds. my wife\\'s main course  -striped bass - was very tasty but the filet was very small and it came with some disgusting fried bits of potato. these were supposed to be \\'smashed fingerling potatoes\\' and she did not expect them to be deep fried. as for my \\'seafood\\' paella it came in a tiny bowl and there was one of each piece of seafood..one mussel, one piece of lobster, one scallop, etc. it was so small i felt compelled to complain to the waiter. he was very nice and brought me a second helping...much bigger..but still in the same tiny bowl! we both had the panecota for dessert and it was nice. \\n\\nthe waiter was very apologetic and the service was very good and quick. the couple next to us seemed to have gone for the regular menu and their portions seemed very generous, so we probably should have done that. their chicken didn\\'t look very appetizing seemed very greasy and over-fried. \\n\\nalso the tables in the restaurant are ridiculously close together. definitely not the place for a romantic meal or any kind of privacy whatsoever., stopped in here last night after a function with some coworkers. we were one table of 6 in the joint. while i realize that there were all of 2 servers, it still took 15 minutes to get a server at our table. she took drink orders for the 2 guys that were with us and ignored us, the 2 girls, at the table. after being there for an hour (20 minutes of which were spent waiting at the bar, trying to get a bartender\\'s attention), we left without getting anything. i will never waste my time here again.\\n\\ni gave it two stars as i have eaten here twice before and the food is solid. that being said, the service leaves a lot to be desired., not at all impressed with this place for breakfast. we were staying at palomar and thought this would be a good option considering most of the restaurants attached to kimptons are good quality, boy were we wrong. service was so slow (and it was a very slow morning in there), breakfast menu very basic and very over priced. coffee weak. not worth $60 for 2 people for breakfast that didn\\'t even have a mimosa. don\\'t waste your time or money., you don\\'t accept cash?  i don\\'t think you grasp the ramifications of such a corpo-fascist economic principle.  no room for arrogant commies in my diet thank you so very very little.  can\\'t wait to see this place nosedive\\n\\nfor anyone in the dark about this policy,  watch mike judge\\'s film, idiocracy. pay close attention throughout the hospital scene.\\n\\n \"unscannable!!!\", worst service ever. i love other sweetgreen locations, but i\\'ll never come to this one agian. there wasn\\'t any line and 4 people were working. i stood there for about  3 minutes. 2 employees by the register called over to the 2 employees talking in front of me to tell them they had customers. they blew off their coworker, looked at me, then carried on. after another minute one finally turned to me and that\\'s when i said i was glad they found the time for me but i won\\'t be ordering and walked away. they laughed at me as i left., not sweet on the green -back\\n\\nwtf this place doesn\\'t accept cash.  they have some kind of an uppity placard about how paying with credit is better. total bs. \\n\\ntook fifteen minutes to wait for the three people in front of me to place their orders.  would have been the same time if we all paid in cash.  the people working here are slow, regardless of payment type.\\n\\nit\\'s a salad. there are two other salad joints in this mall that will make your salad two times as fast and take cash., the salad was sandy, no bread available and the employees looked miserable.   this chain has gone downhill.  can\\'t wait for cava to come to kop., here today at the mall. the staff completely ignored me after i purchased a fish taco bowl. it was spicy and great,but i needed water. the staff has the cups. i stood at the cash register for 6 minutes,  even though there was staff present to help. what a pain., food is decent but employees are miserable. also there\\'s no butter for the bread or plain unsweetened tea., let\\'s start with how rude my order started and how when i asked with stuff was the employee was curt and rude. she continually picked food she knocked out of my bowl back into it after it touched a dirty counter. she rolled her eyes when the dressing i wanted was out and she had to walk to her more. then she proceeded to drown my salad. then after paying for goat cheese she left it all on the tongs she used. i\\'ll go back to honey grow where no one puts ingredients that touch a dirty counter back into my bowl where i can see it., amazing salads and fresh ingredients, but the workers are really rude. most employees seem miserable and put me in a bad mood (some are nice tho). \\n\\nwhenever i order here i get hella stressed bc the employees scare me. anyways, the hummus tahini is dank. \\n\\nalso they yelled at my dumbass cousin for putting her hand over the glass :(, first time visiting the east coast, (cali girl) and sweet green was by far my favorite place to get salads however.... i did feel a bit attacked by the employees ( mainly the girls ). it was my first time there and i asked what the fan favorite is and she looked at me like i had chocolate on my face. she then rolled her eyes... my second time there i asked for vinegar and she damn near drenched it in balsamic and asked if i wanted more.... but shit that salad was good as fuck. also my dumbass cousin tried to pay with cash and they only take card., ordered a guacamole greens salad to go and when i got home, i realized they forgot the chicken and tortilla strips. so basically, i paid almost $10 for a bowl of greens, tomato, and avocado. rip off., i used to live in center city and loved the rittenhouse location.  i then moved out to kop and was excited to have one near me again.  this was has been constantly disappointing.  i\\'ve tried 4 times in the last year (i kept assuming it was just a fluke), but they keep having the same 2-3 problems.\\n\\n1) the employees, are anything but friendly or helpful (as many others have noted).  \\n2) i tell them i want light dressing sometimes and they end up mixing in an ungodly amount (salad is basically ruined as i am now drinking dressing)\\n3) ask for the salad to not have an item on it?  don\\'t worry, they absolutely won\\'t listen to your request.\\n4) they are always out of something.  i get this happens with a \"farm to table\" style restaurant but put up a sign of give a warning before putting together the salad (i also don\\'t remember this happening with such frequency at the center city location -- not sure how that\\'s a thing).  it\\'s frustrating enough when they don\\'t have vital ingredients to the only item they sell -- salads.  but this last time was tomatoes.  i was between choosing 2 different salads (one with tomatoes and one without) and not until it was \"too late\" to get a different salad did they tell me they were out.  offered to substitute it with something else, but why wouldn\\'t you put a sign up saying you\\'re out of tomatoes or give me a heads up when i first ordered one that comes with them??  a burger restaurant wouldn\\'t put all the ingredients on a bun, tell me they\\'re out of burgers, ask me if i\\'d like to substitute for chicken and, if not, i\\'m sol.  \\n\\n0/4 and it\\'s disappointing because i truly liked the center city and ardmore locations, but this one just flat out fails., this store was nice to go to until they tried to sell half eaten salad. i ordered a pick up for two salads and when i had arrived to pick it up, there were no pick up orders on their shelf. granted, i was about 40 minutes late to pick it up due to errands. i looked on their counter and i see two salads, with one already half-eaten. i ask them if that\\'s our order and they mumble and take the half-eaten one to the back and come back with it wrapped. i confronted them about it and they don\\'t properly answer and say that it was left open because they had no lid(?), which i saw them take out immediately from the counter underneath. they tried to give me the half-eaten salad, until i confronted them! i know i was late to pick up, but the store was still open for another 40 mins. \\n\\nbottom line: pick up your online order on time unless you want the employees to eat your order!!, found a beard hair at the bottom of my salad (i don\\'t have a beard) as i was finishing up...gross! complained through the website with a photo of it, twice, and nothing happened., ordered using the app. the order was totally messed up. i ordered chicken but there was no chicken and some corn and nuts were there that i didn\\'t order. don\\'t recommend if you have allergies, i am very unimpressed with the quickness of this particular sweet green. every time i visit this location in the mall, it can be a monday or a weekend it is always so busy and their are never enough people working the line. i can spend 20 minutes in line waiting to order when theirs only 8 people in line. it\\'s super frustrating regardless of how awesome this chain is. staff more people at this busy king of prussia mall location., service was super slow with only one person ahead of me. then when i checked out i asked for a fork. no forks cause i covid. i was advised i should get one from another food place nearby. awkward. so i used two straws as chopsticks. more awkward., let me start with: i love sweetgreen. literally my fav salad spot and whenever i\\'m around a spot that has one i almost always go for lunch or dinner! the salads are always amazing, fresh and they give you a good amount of everything! \\nas for this location...lol. i was working in the kop mall today and decided to mobile order. oh boy was that a mistake. i go up to the to go area, and all that is there is an empty bag and some trash. one employee was helping a customer in line, one not paying attention to me and the other 3 all sitting down in the seating area for customers. i asked the gentleman if my to go order was ready and my name. he stared at me and yelled at the girl sitting down to come help me. she didn\\'t get up. i\\'m looking crazy now with just waiting and seeing my salad on their counter. finally after 4 more people straggle in to clock in, someone finally helps me. really inconsiderate and made me feel like an outcast.  this team needs better training on customer service and mobile order pick ups. this is supposed to be a convenient aspect and i wish i just ordered right in line at that point. won\\'t return to this location again., the salad was good but the service was horrible. the people working there are rude and unprofessional. no greeting, no eye contact, no motivation, no thank you after paying. i also asked for a small amount of dressing and the girl squirted a ton of dressing on my salad. there are many other places for a salad at the mall, go elsewhere., got the green goddess salad (i think that\\'s what it\\'s called). it was $12 for one of the worst salads i\\'ve ever had. i asked for medium dressing and my salad got soaked in an overly oily vinaigrette. it made the whole salad soggy. i ended up taking 3 bites and throwing the whole thing out. then, as i was checking out, one of the workers said \"we have 5 more hours of this s***\" to the woman who was checking me out. huge waste of money, they had my ingredients missing and did not bother telling me! when i asked them for a credit they said i have to email. what a scam. i was a pickup and they did not bother telling me. they thought i would just go home and realize and it would be too late to ask for a refund. unfortunately for them, i was still in the mall and eating it and went back for a refund and they told me to go email and they wouldn\\'t be able to refund me at the store, which is truly a pain. their app allows them to charge you for things they don\\'t have but yet can\\'t refund you if they don\\'t have them and on and on top of it they don\\'t even tell you that the ingredients are missing., i was disappointed during my recent visit, and felt that this place unfortunately has declined.  you can tell when workers have pride and care about the food they\\'re serving -- sadly the team i got on a friday night could not have cared less. and yeah i know this is basically fast food... but it can be soooo good, or not. the person assembling my shroomami bowl in front of me put limp, watery, rotten green matter into my bowl, and when i asked what it was she identified it-- with a blank stare--as basil. after i asked her to remove it (and her manager told her to throw the rest of the basil in the trash) she did offer to sub it with another veg... but qa was very obviously lacking. fried tofu pieces (which come with this salad) were hacked unevenly from bite size to huge pieces.  raw beets were not sliced thinly or evenly, as in the past.  this is still one of the healthier options at kop mall, but i\\'ll probably opt to go home to make my own salad next time --or just suck it up and eat next door at shake shack!, i visited sweetgreen on a quiet evening. two men in front of me were being served by at least three employees. there was a great deal of socializing, both among the employees and between the employees and the other two customers. after waiting for too long for anyone to even acknowledge me, i gave up and left for california tortilla, who seemed to actually want my money., ordered two salads for pickup. they forgot the sweet potatoes in both of them, and they only filled the bowl up halfway. will never go to this location again., after seeing other reviewers rave, i ordered a shroomami bowl as it is without modifications. i asked for medium to light dressing. \\n\\nthe bowl is a generous amount of kale, grain, beet slices, mushrooms, tofu cubes and seeds. it wasn\\'t awful, but it was really boring to eat. the texture was pretty homogeneous after a while and there was so much of this damn bowl to eat. \\n\\nthe flavor all in all wasn\\'t so delicious. it wasn\\'t much of a joy to eat for a non-vegetarian that wanted something light. the dressing was also flavorless with the rest of the ingredients and just made the kale oily.\\n\\nsweetgreen has a ton of other options so i wouldn\\'t hesitate trying something else, but i wouldn\\'t order this dish again; too much and too much of a mediocre thing with this one., ordered a crispy rice bowl-swap out the chicken, swap out the spicy cashew dressing. girl says okay. guess who got chicken and spicy cashew dressing on their bowl. unfortunately didn\\'t realize until after i left. probably won\\'t come back to this location. awful., its unfortunate that this restaurant has to hire such terrible people... the delivery driver was one of the rudest people i have ever encountered. my girlfriend placed the order but was indisposed at the time of the initial delivery call that happened at 4:25 pm and i answered the subsequent call 5 minutes later to be harassed and yelled at by the delivery driver for not answering the call. i apologized but he continued to yell at me on the phone. when i went down to pick up my food he continued to harass me outside of my apartment and yell at me after he gave me the food. i wish we hadn\\'t already tipped him on grubhub or else he would have received zero dollars., if i could give 0 stars i would. this place is trash. first of all they kept telling me the wrong total price so i had to keep adding more food to meet the delivery charge until i realized when i got the receipt, they added the tax after the delivery charge so it was at least $10 over the real total!!!! all this so i can satisfy my craving of sweet potato fries and what do i get. burnt sweet potato fries. why even deliver them to me? who would eat this? disgusting. no class, all about the money., meh, the pizza was underwhelming and relatively expensive for the small size i got. they only offer three sizes, small, large and extra large (new size just introduced) but the small for around $18 was not worth the money. the thin crust was crunchy, had a light blackened taste - it was good. but the tomato sauce was too sweet and the pepperonis were kinda soggy. the small size pizza was smaller than i\\'d expect for the price as well., worst pizza i ever had. sauce is too sweet. pizza is not suppose to taste like that and i\\'ve been feeling sick all day. don\\'t go here, ordered two pizzas last week just too try a new place.  this pizza is definatelly an acquired taste.  crust looked like the ready made crusts you get at a bowling alley and it was not cooked well.  there was a swirl of sauce on top that tasted more like a marmalade than a tomato sauce.  i am sure some people will like this but not us., i was really excited to try this super sweet sauce, especially being a sweet sauce lover.  however, this tasted as if an entire bag of sugar was poured on the pizza.  it was just overwhelming and unsatisfying.  beyond the sauce, the margarita pizza was under-cooked and by the end, was getting over-saturated with sauce to the point it was falling apart.  the pizza was a thin crust, and another minute in the oven would likely have done it more justice.  that said, i will not be back., i think franzones sucks and i haven\\'t even tried the food yet..i ordered my food at 7:15 and it\\'s now ...............8:45, sometimes the pizza is really good. other times it\\'s meh. tonight was undercooked. it\\'s never consistent. and the customer service is bad.  the guy at the counter was so rude tonight that i probably won\\'t be back again., i\\'ve heard mixed things about franzone\\'s. people either love it or hate it, but i wanted to give it a shot. unfortunately their delivery driver in the blue suv drives around like a maniac, blew a stop sign, tailgated me up the street, then nearly ran me off the road as i tried to parallel park because he was in such a hurry. i\\'m an amazing parker by the way and had only just put my blinker on and begun to back into the spot before the driver impatiently zoomed around me and had to slam on the brakes to avoid hitting oncoming traffic. he then ran the next stop sign. i can\\'t justify patronizing a business that employs people that put neighbors at risk like that., i will never order delivery from here again. over an hour and a half later and still no food. they were unwilling to refund or offer some sort of discount. they were also unapologetic about this obscene mistake. i don\\'t even want to know what the food tastes like, especially if the service is this poor and the attitudes are that sour., literally the dumbest employees ever. guy working tonight taking order on phone couldn\\'t answer simple questions. lost my order even the grub hub employee who tried to help was like yea they hung up on me. grub hub had to actually turn off their ordering since the guy was such an a hole. zestos is better anyway., i really wanted to love franzones due to the convenient location and my desire for a solid local pizza joint. that being said, after my third meal here i have concluded that while the service is provided with a smile, the menu leaves a great deal to be desired.\\n\\nmy first take out order went awry when i received a margherita pizza that was a pasty mess of pale dough, drenched in terribly sweet sauce, with wilted basil thrown on top. the mozzarella was nowhere to be seen and our friend who was visiting commented he had \"never seen such an ugly pizza.\"\\n\\nour second order resulted in a mediocre cheesesteak  (stick to sorrentino\\'s across the street.)\\n\\ntoday was the final meal. we ordered a cheese pizza, sandwich, and wrap. the pizza came with way too much sauce, flavorless cheese, and the dough while crunchy tasted heavily of flour and was pale in appearance. my wrap, was served warm without the parmesan or caesar dressing it was meant to be composed of. it was inedible and my significant other\\'s sandwich was tossed after several bites.\\n\\ni\\'ll forgo the convenience for a meal more palatable. sadly, this franzone\\'s seems worlds apart from the other locations. two stars for service and a sad tummy still rumbling., delivery takes over an hour and it showed up cold.  kind of a shame because it would be one of the better manayunk pizzas if they were more attentive to these service aspects., i have to say, the first pie i got from here was on point, and ever since, the quality has gotten worse and worse. i honestly think at this point i\\'ll just go to the conshy location because their product is consistent., this place is all about personal preference.  do you like your sauce very sweet or not.  for me, the sauce is just not good.  i actually ordered a cheesesteak and fries from here but asked for a side of pizza sauce to try.  not my thing.  i also asked for marinara sauce as sometimes i like to turn my cheesesteak into a pizza steak.  the marinara was awful....no spices added at all....tasted like someone squeezed tomatoes into a cup and served it.  i watched the guy make my cheesesteak and was amazed to see nothing added....he literally pulled the frozen meat out, put it on the grill, and cooked it.....added some onions eventually but no salt, pepper, etc.  people are friendly but there are far better pizza and food options.  pat\\'s and bobby\\'s (the last place in this space) was 100 times better., i\\'m not sure what\\'s going on at this place but it really has gone down hill yet the prices are still on the higher side of pizza shops.\\n\\ni rarely feel ripped off when ordering from a pizza shop but ordering 2 large pizzas and 36 wings for $70 then getting wings the size of my pinky. no i don\\'t have huge giant hands i have average hands.\\n\\nthe pizza is decent but even that has gone a bit downhill. their other locations definitely taste better. \\n\\nprobably won\\'t be ordering from here anymore., the only people who could possibly like this pizza are drunk at 2am.  the crust has no flavor, the sauce is too sweet, and the cheese is gross.  ordered delivery to see what all the hype was about, took too long.  we also receive coupons we could not use.  no thanks!, for drunken yuppies on weekend nights. \\nvery bland, cardboard tasting pizzas with a way to sweet pizza sauce.\\nnot at all close to being as good as their original bridgeport location. well overpriced.\\ndesperation stop when nothing else is open., this is the worst pizza i\\'ve had in recent memory. i actually ate it 5 minutes ago and it was so infuriatingly bad, i dropped what i was doing to warn against anyone making the same mistake we did. if you\\'re looking for a warm, gooey cheese pizza (which i was), go someplace else. literally do not even think about going here. first, the sauce is sweet. like, really sweet. that would have been somewhat tolerable, but this swirl thing they do results in thin layers of cold, congealed cheese in between mounds of sweet sauce. why - for god\\'s sake, why - is the cheese so cold? the crust was so underdone, it was basically raw. basically no redeeming qualities. we actually picked up the pizza about ten minutes after ordering it, so i\\'d hate to see how cold and gross it gets if you order delivery. will never order from here again. so disappointing., decided to order for the first time, maybe they just had a bad day? my pizza came mushy, toppings slid right off. the cheese is white and gummy with no flavor. also, i had a hard time finding the sausage? i mean, i saw a few pieces but definitely not $28 dollars worth. the sauce is sweet, which i typically like but what i got was a pizza that was just pizza soup with no redeeming quality to speak of. now, i thought the staff was nice, the place looks like a pizza place, no issues with those two things. did they have a bad day? i\\'m not sure, but i won\\'t order $28 dollar pizza unless all others pizza places close. ate two pieces, picked a sausage off and the rest went in trash., for the service here i would honestly give a 1 but the quality of the pizza is pretty good. i want to love this place because my friends swear by it but the service here just doesn\\'t cut it. yes they are fast with your order and yes the pizza does taste pretty good(maybe one of the better places in manayunk) however the servers/cooks (whoever i have encountered on the phone) have always been extremely rude every time i order from here. also every time i order pizza from here the slices are cut very carelessly and uneven- some of the slices are cut into tiny slivers while the other half of the pie has huge slices- just totally disproportional and seems as if they don\\'t care about customer satisfaction. as a whole it honestly makes my dining experience poor and i would rather spend my money else where instead of a place that doesn\\'t value their customers and are just plain rude. it\\'s disappointing because this place has a lot of potential but until the attitude of the workers here improve i would suggest spending your money elsewhere., god awful french fries. they were inedible. its like they tried to disappoint me. for that i should give them 5 stars. i wish i could get my money back so i could burn it in front of the owner and show them a better use of my money. i will never return. seriously if you mess up fries this bad you deserve to be out of business., after reading other reviews on here and after my first experience i guess i should not have ordered the pizza here. it was unbelievably disgusting. the first time i ordered the pizza it was mediocre. this last time was by far the worse pizza i ever had delivered. i would prefer a frozen pizza from the local grocery store before i order here again and i don\\'t do frozen pizza. the problem isn\\'t the sauce. that is unique to this place and while i am not a fan of the sweet sauce the pizza had far more problems then just being too sweet. the pizza was swimming in sauce. literally dripping off the slice as you tried to eat it. also the toppings were scarce. so basically you ended up with some sort of sweet tomato soup and some dough to dip it in. do yourself a favor and order elsewhere., this pizza was a hate crime to all italians and also everyone, and their onion rings are fake. real fast delivery tho. (all stars for the delivery)\\n\\nseriously the food was so sus the dog wouldn\\'t eat it., ordered buffalo chicken cheesesteak pizza and plain crust with dried checked pieces. no sauce. no cheese. prob the worst pizza i\\'ve ever had., very underwhelming. i was excited to try because i am always looking for a new delivery place to add to my list. i ordered an extra sauce/ well done pizza, wings, and a cobb salad. the pizza was drowned in sauce, virtually inedible, and very soggy. the salad was bland with very little avocado. the wings were nothing special. there are much better wings. we will not be ordering from here again., i placed an order on the slices app at 7:36, the restaurant closes at 8:45. after not getting a response or confirmation for 30 minutes i called to check on the status of the order. i was rudely told \"yeah well our tablets are down and if you need delivery we aren\\'t doing that\" this is the second time in a row my order was placed well before closing and i was rudely spoken to on the phone. if you don\\'t want to deliver until your hours you have posted then correct the hours., we just ordered an extra large half pineapple half bacon pizza from here. very disappointed. the whole pizza was pineapple and bacon ....not what we ordered  and the order of fries  were awful as well. we won\\'t be ordering here again. disappointed for sure , not worth 40 bucks .  don\\'t waste you\\'re money!!!, inedible, undercooked pizza. sauce tastes like sugar. soup was way too salty to eat. really bad., truly terrible. pizza had no flavor (other than sickeningly sweet), was soggy, undercooked, and doughy. the chicken pesto wrap was lettuce, cubed chicken, and pesto on an untoasted wrap, and the salad was not much better: raw onion, raw tomato, and the same cubed chicken on spinach. so bad our labrador didn\\'t even look up or beg for scraps., pizza was ok lot of sugar in the sauce, cheese steak was nasty all fat, and the fries were soggy the best part was the soda, will never order here again, almost two hours for all food to be cold and forgot items., ordered a large half marg/ half cheese(plain). it was sooooo saucy and the sauce is very sweet. the margherita was like i was biting into just sauce. the dough is flavorless. also, don\\'t get robbed and order the wings. so tiny, so breaded, not crispy. upon leaving, i had to go back and ask for blue cheese bc they give you nothing for your wings, and they gave me the smallest mini sauce container i\\'ve ever seen. will not be going back., i just ordered delivery from here. they forgot my meal(salad), forgot to take the tomatoes off the wrap as asked, and forgot the side of ranch as requested. it is obvious that you do not check your orders prior to finalizing and delivering them. oh yeah, and it took over an hour to deliver., detective mike here to investigate the hype at this local favorite.\\n\\nthe sauce is very sweet, when i first bit into my slice even though i did not drink an ounce of alcohol before ordering i thought i ordered a freaking dessert. \\n\\none slice with two toppings ran me $3.25....would you like a two liter of soda here well that will run you $3.56.  although you come here when you feel like you want to save a few dollars it certainly did not give off the vibe that  you are getting a great deal. you can add most toppings to a plain slice and they pop it in the oven however the toppings appear that they are falling off the slice when you recieve your food. i tried the eggplant parm on a different stop here before and it made me feel queasy. \\n\\nyour next best option for pizza is right on main street next to greg\\'s kitchen, there pizza comes out extremely hot and i prefer the quality of  there food much better. to each there own but i have tried franzone\\'s enough times that i know i will not be back., pizza has the strangest, sweetest sauce i\\'ve ever had. not enough cheese. pizza is so soggy that you can\\'t pick it up. last time we ordered here, we got home only to realize that the toppings weren\\'t what we ordered., i ordered a cheese pizza and mac & cheese bites from franzone\\'s and was disappointed in both. i couldn\\'t finish the pizza because it tasted so bad and it had no flavor. the dough had no crunch, the sauce was too sweet and the cheese was bland. none of the ingredients tasted fresh either. the mac & cheese in the mac & bites also had no flavor and had too much breading. \\n\\ni compared different pizzerias near me to see where i wanted to order from and franzone\\'s pizza was about $3-4 more expensive than the other pizzerias. unfortunately, i will not be a repeat customer., we got delivery from franzones in conshy last night. it was literally the worst meal i have ever had. everything tasted like cardboard. the pizza was flimsy and the chicken fingers were disgusting. i will never order from here again., tried to place an order for pickup around 8pm last thursday night on the slice app, but once i added everything to my cart it said they weren\\'t accepting orders. i checked their hours, saw they were still open, and i placed my order for chicken fingers with fries and wings over the phone.\\n\\non the walk back from picking up the food i noticed the fries weren\\'t in the bag. i called and asked if it was a mistake because i had noticed both on the app and on menu on google (pictures attached) that it said the chicken fingers came with fries. the cashier was very rude to me on the phone, told me i must have read it wrong, and tried to hang up on me... after i had just given a generous tip on my pickup order.\\n\\ni get it, if it\\'s a misunderstanding, or if the menu online is outdated, that\\'s fine, just explain that in a courteous way and if i want fries offer me the opportunity to come back, pay, and wait for them. instead she said they were closed at 8:24 pm when the posted hours say they\\'re open till 10 pm.\\n\\nthe chicken fingers were fine. the wings were deep fried fat on a bone with 0 meat. there are plenty of better pizza places in the neighborhood so my advice would be to not waste your time or money here., oh dear god, where do i begin?\\n\\ni should probably start off by saying i was utterly ravenous during my first and last visit. i drank too much the night before, couldn\\'t hold my liquor, and paid for it greatly. so on the day my pops and i visited franzone\\'s, it was around 3 o\\'clock and i\\'d eaten *nothing*. not. a. damn. thing.\\n\\nso do you know that deep hunger that makes all food taste great, even garbage? not even my intense hunger pangs could compel me to love this pizza. the by-the-slice options looked dubious at first glance. the fact they toss any chosen toppings on before reheating exacerbated this dubiousness, so we both chose plain slices.\\n\\nmy slice fell apart upon lifting (into three pieces!!!) and was woefully over-sauced. i actually liked the sauce and didn\\'t mind its sweeter flavor, but there was way too much of it. that\\'s about the only positive thing i can say, and i doubt a fresh-baked pie would do anything to change my mind. the crust was average and needed salt and the cheese was fine. skip this one. there are better pies around, and they\\'re not hard to find., not covid safe. no masks, even when you walk in they don\\'t even pretend to put them on. they make several pizzas at a time so there\\'s always one there waiting for you but it\\'s usually cold. i like their pizza so will come back but if you\\'re worried about covid, avoid!!, first time i went to earl\\'s new american kitchen i liked the food it was good wasn\\'t great but it was a ok \\n service not so great sat at the bar did not really care for a bartender tried it again second time bartender was really rude i would never go back there  or recommend it to anyone, the food tastes great but portions are small. first, we ordered fried calamari, which is always a shareable appetizer. it was s portion meant for one person. for my main coarse i ordered surf & turf. ( $38.00 ) i asked the waiter if the amount of filet mignon medallions would be sufficient...he said \" yes, it\\'s s big portion\".  i received two small medallions, each being bite size. the lobster was also small but i expected that. when i brought my dissatisfaction to the waiters attention , he agreed that there should have been more and apologized. that was it ! nothing was done to rectify the extremely small portion. thankfully, i was able to fill up on the steak fries. for the price i paid, i should not have left hungry. so, if you have s small appetite, this is the place for you., this place is just terrible .  started off with lobster dumplings that tasted like they came out of bag bought in costco.  pork belly over some thing that i think was grits. my wife had some sort of grilled salmon with sweet potato hash.. and i had striped bass over far risotto...i have no idea what that was swimming in...they must of had a lot of left over pumpkin spice from the fall because everything tasted like it waste of 100 bucks....wtf, if you want to pay a lot for what now has the feel of a diner, then by all means go. otherwise there are so many other quality places around. for this money, go to marsha brown\\'s or the black bass, both superior by a mile. this is the third version of earl\\'s i think and it just keeps getting worse. went a few weeks ago and will not be back, bad service (ditsy and slow is no way to go through life), mediocre food, atmosphere of a diner, etc. i don\\'t know who is making the decisions over there now, but they really failed with this one., they had no puppies. highly disappointed by the lack of puppies or any dogs in general. food was ok(burgers were dry). waiter was friendly and very kind. won\\'t go back until they get at least 1 puppy dog., we went for lunch during the scarecrow festival and i should have known not to go here when the festival was packed and you couldn\\'t even find parking spot, yet earls was empty! the crab bisque was good, not much crab in it but still tasted good. what was really bad was our entrées! my friend got a crabcake sandwich which came with some unusual looking pickled onions? we still don\\'t know what they were. maybe it was a relish? either way it did not look good. her husband got the turkey panini which looked decent. my fiancé and i both got burgers and, mine more than his, were completely burnt even though we asked for them medium well. it was like chewing on a burnt hockey puck! will not be back here! ever!, took my name and number as we were told to wait 10 minutes. came back after 8 minutes, then waited for another 20. we overheard them tell other customers that they will not take any walk-ins. then i chimed up- \"does that mean us too?\" why yes. but you have me on your list- i have never saw you before sir!! really? you asked for my name and phone number! oh yes, i called you several times- you should pick up your phone. i was right here the whole time!! i have an earpiece in my ear!!! nobody called me!!!! what a pos place. too waspy for me., my wife and i did not care for our meal at earl\\'s.  first and foremost, the service was very friendly and knowledgeable.  and the ambiance was pleasant, though not very private.  unfortunately, with the exception of the bread, we did not enjoy our food.  although my scallops were cooked fine, the rest of my plate was bland and tasteless.  throughout my meal, i simply could not grab a bite that included flavor.  my wife ordered a caesar salad that was ruined by a piece of white anchovy.  though it was not noticed until about half way though her meal.  upon revisiting the menu online, the piece of fish is clearly printed, but we must have missed it under the dark lighting.  the croutons in the salad however were stale and difficult to eat pieces of bread from days prior, and the piece of chicken was incredibly small.  \\n\\nthe dishes were probably amiss due to our own personal preference, but it was a highly disappointing experience for us.  although we definitely will not dine again, i\\'m certain that there are folks who would enjoy this contemporary place., had lunch today and ordered a soup and salad.  the soup was excellent but the chopped salad came out using only the yellow and white parts of the romaine lettuce. the salad also had advertised other vegetables which were scarce...not a good presentation at all.  we ordered humus and pita and the pita was too charred. very disappointed and won\\'t be coming back.  also the menu they advertised on trip advisor had more vegetarian options than the menu we were given today., this was recommended to us. we went and were disappointed. the lobster bisque had too much pepper and we couldn\\'t finish it.  there were only 4 scallops for $28 and there was too much pepper even after i wiped them off.  filet mignon was over cooked. disappointed for $100.00 will not return or recommend, i spent the day in peddler\\'s village yesterday. my mother and i heard great things about earl\\'s and were looking forward to dining there. we entered and waited to be seated, with another couple in front of us waiting. two young men were at the maitre d podium. they were talking about matters other than business, looked at us, and turned back to each other. when i spoke up and asked to be seated, they continued to ignore me. there are plenty of other dining options and i will not patronize an establishment where i am blown off by college age children. we left. i\\'m not sure how the food is, but the service is shameful., went away for the weekend, decided to try out earl\\'s new american.\\n\\nwalked in an was barely greeted by the host.\\n\\nstarted with 1/2 dozen oysters & crab cocktail was okay.\\n\\nbaby beets salad came out with 3 extremely tiny pieces of beets over arugula.\\ndid not even warrant being called a beet salad.\\n\\nseared shrimp was absolutely awful, the entire dish was bland. the red sauce tasted like diluted ketchup.\\n\\nvery disappointed.....will not go back again., saturday 1/27/18\\nhad a reservation in advance. they sat us at a table the size of ventnor sitting across from each other and the most uncomfortable table possible.\\nwe ask to relocate and they moved us to a table that was located in the hallway entering another dining area with only one other table. \\n\\nok we finally order drinks and they arrive. the waitress is very nice and takes our dinner order.\\n\\nthe dinner arrived only for the girls and 5 min later \\n3 dinners for the guys arrived.\\nthis makes no sense. two dinners were surf & turf.\\nshould of been called cold & tough! the lobster was about 1 oz and you had to use both hands to pull the lobster meat out, the filet was like warm and not cooked to order. ordered med well and was\\nheavy well ( no pink ) the baked potatoes were cold. the manager attempted to remake another surf & turf and no different! ok, so this is a 4+ restaurant with entrees that in average are $ 32 plus dollars. the sure and turf was $ 42.00.\\ni would of felt better fasting and donating that cost to children\\'s hospital!  the manager after 2 attempts deducts one surf and turf, but two\\nwere ordered and deducts the spouses dinner for only $ 34.00. he also picks up the tab for 3 mixed drinks and 3 beers. all 6 dinners were below mcdonalds standards and i felt that the manger\\ncould of handled the situation in a much better fashion. 6 adults driving 25 miles to dinner\\nand meals that are cooked badly and serving\\nluke warm and cold food for this price is a disgrace. total bill $ 450.00 including tip less his deductions $ 165.00 grand total due for below average quality food $ 285.00. earls,\\nif your reading this, reach out to me and see if you want our future business. if so willing to listen to make up for a horrible experience at your restaurant. maybe next time we can sit in the actual dining room. until manager or owner reaches out \\nthis organization gets negative 2 stars.\\nthere are much better places to eat that satisfies your dining needs at the same if not less expensive prices. we are not complaining about the cost\\nbut food quality and prep, 1/27 evening,\\nway below average!  waiting for manger\\nreply and i will gladly follow up\\n\\nthank you\\ndavid r, i thought it was only ok!   great location especially during holiday season (watching the holiday lights).   if you want to go to peddler\\'s village it\\'s an ok place to eat.  not worth the drive for earl\\'s itself., very mediocre, we had dinner for a table of 8, overall view was about the same, food quality decent, meal prep - decent, plates very hot, food frankly not, it just wasn\\'t a great experience. there are a lot of dinner options out there. i would slide this one down the list a ways. to be clear, staff was polite, we were too, it just isn\\'t all that good. try elsewhere instead, the bartender is the worst!!!!  he was rude and obnoxious!!!!  i am referring to the bartender on duty at 1:00 sunday, november 3rd. we are 6 mature females that waited over an hour. we only ordered salads and soup!!!?!?  to add insult to injury when we inquired about our order he very loudly barked that he was waiting for the kitchen??!  we finally left without eating!  having someone like this working in your establishment is definitely a money losing situation. he does not begin that job unless you want to loose customers.  we would never go back or ever recommend that place !, overpriced and low quality food. ordered the lobster tail which was undercooked and tasteless.  it was only 4 ounces but cost$42!!  came with a few spears of asparagus, and a glass of champagne which wasn\\'t great. i would have rathered a potato.  waiter was strange. we had to repeatedly ask for bread which he didn\\'t bring until the end of the meal.  we used to come here a lot before they reorganized. the food was great even though it was pricey. i don\\'t mind spending the money if the quality is worth it. sorry to say we won\\'t be eating here anymore., that\\'s it never again!  this was the second time we had a pretty awful $125.00+ inc dinner for two in the past year.  the price was for one pretty awful cocktail and one beer, one soup, two entree\\'s, one desert, and two coffees.\\n\\nwhat happened to this place?  the quality of food & service has deteriorated so badly.  what a disappointment!\\n\\ni was hesitant to try earl\\'s again after the last bad experience but because it was a birthday dinner invite i went along with the restaurant selection.\\n\\nfirst - my whiskey sour was just plain awful - old or bad bottle mix.  i\\'d expect this quality at a low end chain restaurant.  for the prices charged there\\'s no reason why it couldn\\'t be fresh hand crafted.\\n\\nsecond - how can you not have a basic garden green side salad on the menu?  the waitress looked annoyed when we asked.\\n\\nthird - both the filet and braised beef came with literally a puddle of clear grease on the plate and both meats were dry and tasteless.  my tiny filet was placed on top of a big glob of mashed potatoes which had no flavor at all and served with the same greasy braised short rib sauce.\\n\\nforth - the cheesecake desert ridiculous.  it was literally all air - it was so whipped it was more of a parfait than cake.  i guess this earl\\'s way of getting a normal cheesecake for one to extend to four deserts.  then there was some strange tasteless off color whipped cream drop served as decoration.\\n\\nfifth - the service was really subpar.  two mature ladies couldn\\'t or wouldn\\'t handle the handle tables on a rainy midweek night.  it shouldn\\'t take twenty minutes to get a refill of their small coffee cup.\\n\\nbasically earl\\'s has become a pricey tourist trap.\\n\\nwon\\'t be back a next time., we have been coming to earl\\'s for a few years, the service has taken a nose dive.  we ordered oyster, then a salad along with dinner.  long story short we waited well over 30 minutes for salad and then another 40 for dinner.  the story was the pasta was not cooked to the chef\\'s liking.  unfortunately the steak frites must have been waiting and was cold and and fries were in a clump.  not sure what has gone wrong here but help is needed.  michael at the bar is always on the mark, new servers seem uninterested and do not have the time of day.  very disappointing as earl\\'s was our go to spot in the winter the last few year., this is the first time ever that i have been driven to write a review for a restaurant. my wife and i have been here before and have enjoyed ourselves every time. great atmosphere, food and service. yet on saturday 12/8 we went for a late lunch and everything went down hill. it was busy but not too crazy but the host  was rude and seemed not interested in helping anyone. we got a seat at a round top in the bar area and had a great server but  that is the only good thing i can say about my experience. it took 25 mins to get my beer. we ordered soup and two appetizers. the soup came out in a timely manner but we never saw the appetizers. we waited over an hour for two appetizers and then saw people who sat down well after us getting there food. we then heard the waiter telling people the kitchen was being closed because they got overwhelmed by a large party. our waiter informed us our food was on its way. after 10 minutes of additional waiting we had enough and asked the bar tender to cash us out. she wound up comping our drinks and soups but other than that we got no apology and not so much as a thank you from the host s as we left. my question is how can one large party shut down the kitchen during a late lunch service? how do they manage to operate when they have packed house for dinner? finally why was there not a manager going around apologizing to the customers?, we tried earl\\'s for the first time.  peddler\\'s village is beautifully decorated for christmas.  the food was mediocre and the service was not good.  twice we asked for more bread and it was never brought.  my son asked for refills on his pepsi twice...never brought once.  my son had the fillet which was tender and pretty good.  my wife had the scallops and i had the rigatoni with sausage.  neither plate was worth the entree price. \\n\\nit\\'s unfortunate but when service is so poor as it was here we simply won\\'t return.  i\\'m confident we would have had a better overall experience at the outback at half the price., earl\\'s. well everyone i know around here calls it the salt lick. the one thing they know how to do is use salt. if you know how to cook you don\\'t need to use so much.\\nsorry, we have gone 2 times and both times were horrible., i went to dinner last night and frankly was disappointed!  i had a pork chop that was too tough, was served with polenta that was too salty and brussels sprouts that were not fully cooked!\\nmy wife was happy with the she crab bisque and the lobster appetizer!, went for a late lunch on a saturday.  would not seat us since we didn\\'t have a reservation.  no problem, we sat in the bar and ordered there.  food was above average but service was terrible.  took over 40 minutes for a burger, chicken sandwich and a salad.  bartenders were serving the high tops around the bar.  i don\\'t think i would return.  too many other options, lunch on monday afternoon:\\nordered \\'fish n\\' chips\\' and crab cake platter.\\nthe fried, breaded fish was decent, a bit oily, but acceptable. the crab-cake was also acceptable, but nothing to write home about.   \\nthe platters both came with french fries which were horrendously bad. \\nit\\'s almost as if the kitchen just throws them on the plate as an afterthought, figuring the quality of fries does not matter to the dish. well, these were soggy, over-cooked, tasteless and limp. these went to the trash. \\nadding to the poor experience was the blasting of cold air directly onto the seating area, such that we wished we had worn sweaters, even in the august heat. they really should place \\'air deflectors\\' on the air vents so as not to freeze the customers.  \\non a high note, the server was very good, friendly and attentive., called us 15 min before our reservation to tell us they couldn\\'t accommodate us outside. not sooner when we could make other plans., food wasn\\'t good at all, one plate of fries were so undercooked and another plate of fries were burnt to a crisp and stale. drinks are over priced. the only good thing is that it\\'s the only restaurant around with dog friendly outdoor seating, holy moley did earl\\'s just take a hit in my book, all because of their \"front house manager\" terry. beautiful day here today. we drove up to earl\\'s on the off chance we could get a table. terry greeted us with a sour expression at the host stand. it wasn\\'t busy. no one else waiting or walking in the entire time we were there. lots of empty tables. my husband asked if we could get a table. terry said no. my husband (thinking we were going to be quick) asked about the numerous empty tables - could we get one until the next one showed up - there was a 6 pm reservation that hadn\\'t shown up yet at 6:15? terry, apparently mustering up his best customer service that his management training could offer said \"no! do you want to do my job for me?\" yikes!!! i am not exaggerating - it was that quick until he got super nasty. i still had a smile on my face i was so shocked. until they fire terry don\\'t bother coming here as a potential walk in. we walked into baci and got a great table on the deck with fantastic live music. and no one snarled at us when we walked in., i came for dinner and vegetarian fusilli is so bad... i won\\'t recommend to come to this restaurant. do not waste your money, sadly disappointing. good experience in past, but this time ordered the salad with grilled chicken and strawberries that was their special for the season. took over an hour to come out. when it did, the berries were hidden under the pile of spinach, while i had a few, my husbands had only 2 pieces. very little dressing and dry chicken., i\\'ve been here several times and food has always been good.  today not so much.  \\n\\nwe had the calamari for an appetizer.  it was chewy and not really cooked through.\\n\\nmy husband had the meatloaf sandwich.  words can\\'t describe how bad it looked and tasted.  i wish we would have taken a picture.  the meatloaf color was grayish/black with a heavy thick sauce on top.  my husband has been feeling sick since we left.\\n\\ni had the pastrami salmon sandwich.  it was mostly a blt so can\\'t complain.  \\n\\ntheir homemade chips were good.  unfortunately will not be back here., just rude in person service. food may be good. but front desk and reservation system was poor., wanted to sit outside and order apps and drinks at 3:40, and were told that they had stopped serving lunch which was supposed to be until 4. we left and went to a more accommodating venue., never again. we ordered the chicken thigh sliders as an app and they were bland and unseasoned. i ordered the burger and it was awful. they actually took it off the bill. my husband ordered the salmon pastrami and it was just ok. the worst though is that hallway to the bathroom and the bathrooms smell worse than a port-a- potty in august. it\\'s absolutely disgusting., expected a more upscale , efficiently run establishment. first time here, even though we\\'re in peddlers village at least 4 times a year. hostess who seated us was rude , soft spoken and new in the position. tried to seat us in a corner away from any of the ambiance earl\\'s feels the need to mention in their advertising. the bread actually was the best bread i have had in ages. we ordered meatballs as an appetizer. arrived barely above room temperature, and just were not tasty... hard, disappointing. i ordered the steak... 14oz sirloin , mashed potatoes and asparagus... mashed was good , asparagus was thick stalks, stringy and tasteless. steak was tough, gave my steak knife a workout. i\\'ve gotten a better steak at applebee\\'s; seriously. wife ordered \"airline\"(what ever that means) pan seared chicken... just average. the wait was excessive... over 30minutes between courses. butter nut squash soup was on the specials menu... but not in the kitchen. the adage \"you get what you pay for\" does not apply here. it tries to be pretentious in an area known for it\\'s pretentiousness, like a range rover that\\'s burning oil. been there, done that... not again., eh pretty much sums up my experience at earls tonight for christmas eve. i used to frequent this place and we wanted to come to celebrate christmas. the service was incredibly lacking. we were left alone while the table behind us got constant refills, bread and attention. we were kind of in a back corner and could not get much attention. then the food was also eh, especially for the price. i had the tuna. it was just ok. my mom had the scallops also just ok. there wasn\\'t enough flavor or something. overall i didn\\'t get any of the special dinner christmas spirit. and will not be returning., we found the food, service and atmosphere generally indifferent. maybe because we came on a monday when nearly every other restaurant in the area was closed. earl\\'s was busy,  and we sat outside. it was the groups of people with their dogs watching our every bite hoping for our table and the hostess rushing through announcing which tables were leaving soon that unsettled us. oh and the food.. very small portions of just ok chopped salad and shrimp & grits didn\\'t inspire us either. we will come next time on a day the other restaurants are open., my wife and i walked in to earls and politely asked for a table.  in my entire life, i was never treated so rudely by a hostess (actually 4 hostesses)!  i will never eat at this horrible establishment again.  people really need to learn something about customer service...  i would give it a zero if i could....., rude \"girl\"at the hostess station.  when i asked if there was a table for two, she said in a rather loud voice,  \"2hours.\" and stared. horrid sign of inhospitality., don\\'t waste your time or money.  i had two jura makers, one z5 and one x9, that needed routine service to the brew groups.  when i first found parts guru it was $350 per unit to fix.  when i brought them in the price went up to $500 for one and $550 for the other.  ok; but they said total refurb, good as new.  i got them back and each one had a problem that wasn\\'t there when i brought them in.  worse, they freight shipped it back with some no-name company.  they called to tell me they didn\\'t deliver to residential addresses and i would have to travel 40 miles to their depot and pick them up myself.  you get the idea; spend $1050 and throw your money away.  \\n\\nthe company posts great you tube videos on fixing them yourself, so stick with those., not a very responsive place 3 weeks to repair and then another week before they shipped. overpriced waste of money and time - never go here again., i feel it is very important for me to warn you away from this company. they are extremely dishonest with very poor service. they push the gamea revo / merol me712 machine. i ordered the merol me712, i got a 3 year old games revo. mine arrived defective. it took me months to get it repaired by them. i finally got it back in mid feb. 3 month later, the heater wire has burned up. i contacted them and they told me how to repair and said they would send a new wire. notice that rather than standing behind a product they sell, they are having their customer repair it. i went ahead and opened it up and found the bad wire they told me would be bad. i contacted them again and told them they were right. then they tell me they are going to charge me $12 for the wire. this is their warranty service. have you do the job and charge you for the part. please save your self and don\\'t do business with these people. don\\'t believe the fake reviewers on here. they are horrible people!, i will be taking this bs company to small claims court. they are a scam! told me my jura s8  motherboard was done. and wanted me to donate the machine for parts!!! made me pay for shipping twice . failed both times. actually broke more parts on return and blamed carrier.\\ntook 3 months. i finally got my machine back, sent it to the real andonly palce to send your jura, (jura capresso inc)- (201) 767-3999. they fixed it, diagnosed it. not the motherboard. returned in perfect condition in less than a week!! great service! do not send anything to this company who speciualizes in fraud. good luck., went to store at 0845 as i pulled up to the drive thru i saw the lights go off in the store i waited for a little then decided to pull to the front of the store to check the hours. thats when i saw crew members run to the back and another duck because i saw her. this is beyond unprofessional and i will be filing complaints at all levels possible., the smoothies are ok for the money but it takes them forever to make a smoothies.  whatever you do do not go through the drive through if you want a smoothie in less than 20 minutes.  basically the service at this location is terrible and if you ask to talk to a manager they tell you everyone working here is a manager. which explains why the service is bad.  if everyone is in charge no-one is., my only complaint is that depending on who makes the smoothie, it can taste differently. i get the gladiator chocolate and it is usually good. last time it was made by a guy with glasses who looked nervous and had to make more because my cup wasn\\'t filled. it was not pulsated enough which i didn\\'t notice until i got home. i asked for banana added but didn\\'t taste it. smoothie was bitter and basically tasteless. would have gone back but was in a hurry. cost $9 too for 32 oz. make sure trainees learn not to skip a step. i saw a documentary on how they are made and they follow a list of ingredients. mine was lacking a lot of taste., my family is new to the area! we\\'re from philly home of all the good foods! i came here to visit my family and we decided to google pizzeria\\'s and a few came up! so we decided to give them a shot since the reviews were good! honestly we weren\\'t satisfied at all! everything was nasty! cheesesteak was soggy! buffalo wings were soggy and salty! the only thing that was actually good was their bbq wings! we will never order from here again! sorry not sorry!, its ok the owner likes to degrade his workers every time i stop by.  its very unprofessional. i feel bad for the poor guy making the food. i\\'d wish he would nail the owner. i dont think i will come back here again., the food is absolutely horrible. i\\'ve tried this place over and over and the food just keeps getting worse. i took 2 bites out of my cheesesteak and tossed it. same with the wings., i ordered here a while ago. \\ni ordered a cheeseburger, broccoli bites and fries. \\ni got a burnt burger on a hoagie roll. lol a hoagie roll. they never called me back and said we ran out of rolls is this ok or would you like something else. nothing just brought me a burnt cold burger patty onba hoagie roll with some gross mushy lettuce on it. broccoli bites were burnt. terrible. never again., first time, last time. \"pan\" pizza ... super thin and not fully cooked which is tough to do with a thin crust and conveyer style oven. just wasn\\'t good., understanding that there\\'s a snowstorm out today we decided to place an order for a small pizza and a hoagie we understood it would take some time and after an hour and a half we placed a couple calls to find out the driver showed up at the wrong order so i called aston pizza back just to let them know and i got attitude from the person that answered the phone this is a place i order quite a bit i understand the frustration having been in the food business myself and being the only place open that has power and aston still is no excuse for how i was treated on the phone i recommend the food but i don\\'t recommend the person who answered the phone thank you, it\\'s very upsetting to see no employees wear masks. do they care about our safety? food is just ok. will never go back!, we attended a pharmaceutical dinner several months ago and the food was rather disappointing. most of the dishes had a fusion of chinese and european styles. we were served a five course menu and all the dishes were quite small in portion and not too impressive to remember. i do have to say that decor was quite impressive and beautiful with the red silk lanterns hanging from the ceilings., we tried susanna foo this past weekend & after hearing the rave reviews, i thought we were in for a treat! there was a good-sized group of us, the waitstaff was indeed phenomenal. but, the venue was very loud and made it difficult to hold a conversation and the tables and patrons are crowded. unfortunately by the time we sat down (we had a 7:30pm reservation on a saturday) the chef was already out of the fish entree i wanted to order. i asked the waiter if i could substitute any other fish but keep the rest of the order (looking forward to the delicious-sounding sauce i\\'d chosen), and was informed that the chef would not do this. so, since i was holding up the rest of the table i made a quick decision to go with something completely different (scallops) and ended up giving about half of it away., i don\\'t really have too much to say about this place. the service is excellent but the food was very unimpressive. i understand it\\'s supposed to be fusion and not authentic chinese food but fusion doesn\\'t have to mean flavorless. their hot and sour soup was beyond tasteless. my brother had the lamb and it tasted strange....like it\\'s been frozen for a long time. i had the duck and it was the first time i didn\\'t finish a duck dish and he didn\\'t finish a lamb dish. \\n\\nfor good service, clean and classy atmosphere for the big bucks, this is the place. for good food for cheap....and if you\\'re willing to sacrifice some of the other amenities, head to chinatown., sorry, i have to say this is the poorest excuse of a restaurant ever.  what is up with the girls wearing stockings under those shorts.  that\\'s nasty.  and do you guys really like when they sit next to you and act like they want to talk.  oh yeah, i forgot it\\'s every girls dream to sit at a table of fat, chicken wing grease covered, over 40, balding, married guys who may or may not have a pot to piss in.  but you\\'re the same dude that goes to a strip club and thinks the stripper really likes you (dumb ass!!).  this is a joke of a theme restaurant and i am embarrassed to be a human when i see them do that hula hoop act in the middle of the bar.  i\\'ve been to hooters twice and i don\\'t plan on ever going again.  i guess it\\'s okay if you just want some beer and wings but aren\\'t there plenty of local bars that do that part better and with more dignity?  even strip bars have more dignity.  but like grandma used to say, \"...there\\'s an ass for every seat\".  grandma was always right., i was just here in december, and i think it\\'s closing.  really sad since i was one of the first customers to go there back in 1998 when it opened.  too bad.  good stuff., its not closing for good, they just moved locations. new location is by ruth chris near the mall, i think on s gulph mills., horrible, go to acme and buy frozen pizza, will taste better., drove to the restaurant and it is closed, even though the hours listed here indicate it is open. called the phone number and nobody answered. \\n\\nis that good enough for your review standards yelp?  i try to help local venues, but they need to be open to provide a service and earn my payment. i posted my previous review, and this review, to warn others who might travel a reasonable distance only to be disappointed when they find the establishment is not open. serve the whole public yelp, not just the establishments who pay you to hide the honest reviews by the public - the flattering and not so flattering., i will start by saying this place has very good food! very fresh and flavorful! i have one major issue with them over charging when placing the order on line. the total price you are given at the end of your order is always different when they deliver it at your door. it\\'s only a few cents, but to me it\\'s the principal of it. so, i have confronted them a multiple of times after giving them many chances over again and they look at me like i\\'m crazy or better yet that they don\\'t understand! so, the latest i ordered online and proceeded to call in to pay with a credit card to make sure the price was the same. sure enough it was different..... and jack the gentleman working there explained to me that they round up to the nearest 5 or 10 which makes no sense to me what so ever! besides the fact, how can you even do that and get away with it?????? i then ask for the manager and was told he wasn\\'t there, i even asked for the managers name and jack told me he didn\\'t know!! bottom line keep an eye on your receipts and or credit card statements!! i will be sure to never go back and thought i should share this information., this food has the potential to be great but it lacks seasoning.  i\\'ve eaten here three times now and every item i\\'ve ordered consistently lacks seasoning. if it weren\\'t for fish sauce, the meal would\\'ve been as bland as a bowl of steamed rice.  i can tell the flavors are nice but they\\'re muted as well. and despite asking for my thai dishes to be spicy, they\\'re always so mild that i don\\'t get any heat at all., the chinese food from this place just isn\\'t very good. i ordered the kung pao chicken and hot & sour soup.  i dig spicy food so i requested that the kung pao be made extra spicy....and as far as i can tell, there is no chili pepper anywhere in this dish.  it\\'s not just a bland kung pao dish....it\\'s bland food.  there\\'s no seasoning.\\n\\nthis is the second time i\\'ve had a forgettable meal from this place, so i wont be ordering from here again., asian cafe\\'s chinese affair is pretty good, but their sushi is very, very bad. the fish was old and smelled through the packaging. the rice was stale, and they used the wrong ingredients in the roles we ordered.\\n\\nif you want noodles or beef, they\\'re great, but if you\\'re looking for sushi run far, far away. what a waste of $18., strike two. my last visits to asian cafe have been sub-par. first a flavorless roast duck noodle soup (\"chicken\" broth that tastes like water? and tough duck?), and now limp, uninspired, tasteless lo mein. i don\\'t know what\\'s changed in the kitchen, but there\\'s no excuse for flavorless food., this has to be the blandest asian food i have ever eaten! like eating spicy cardboard!, i ordered wonton soup friday night and ate half. it was fine..nothing special.  tonight i reheated it cut into a wonton and found a shrimp!!!!!  i have a shellfish allergy and could have had a serious situation.  clearly this shows a messy kitchen and lacking in food prep.  will never order from here agiain! who knows what else is going on in that kitchen., food is pretty good but don\\'t bother ordering online if you actually want to eat it.  apparently it frequently doesn\\'t submit your order so you have to re-order upon arrival.  the suggested solution to this is to call them to confirm... which defeats the point of ordering online.  discount for waiting?  guess again! dismal service & even worse attitude on the part of the owner\\'s sister... get it together, ordered delivery from them for the first time. had a $90 dollar order, one of the items being a $15 dollar sushi roll that was literally all lettuce. so unhappy. don\\'t waste your time or money unless you\\'re happy with a $15 dollar salad with hot sauce. crab rangoon was all cream cheese not even an imitation crab taste., new to the area so my family decided to buy several different options from asian cafe to try for dinner. out of 6 we only liked 2. the pad thai was particularly disappointing. we ordered chicken but got tofu, which we also like so it wasn\\'t a big deal, but it tasted very fishy for some reason. don\\'t think we\\'ll be trying this spot again., i went back -- if you call getting sushi takeout going back. i hate to say that my original review stands. second time around my sushi was kinda smushy, kinda flavorless and not entirely unlike grocery-store sushi.\\n\\nperhaps the rest of menu rocks? i don\\'t know. my kid\\'s beef & broccoli was good before, so maybe it\\'s just the sushi that\\'s soul-crushingly disappointing? to me, this place is like a katherine heigl movie -- everyone else seems to think it\\'s awesome but i just walk away thinking, \"i paid money for that?\", they have the worst food \\ni\\'ve tried it twice both times terrible \\ni had the pad thai with chicken. just brown noodles with brown chicken, no flavor, not appetizing to look at.\\nno care at all put into the making of this food., why is it that a food industry which built a brand on paper boxes with metal handles has devolved into using nothing but plastic and styrofoam? styrofoam isn\\'t even accepted for recycling by the vast majority of companies in the industry. but beyond that - the food. the first that hit me was the salt. as i lifted the fork to my mouth, i happened to inhale, and could tell before even putting the food in mouth it was incredibly salty. and sure enough it was. this had to be hands-down the saltiest chinese food i have ever eaten. for that reason alone, i won\\'t go back. but if the business is reading its reviews, please cut back on the plastic. it\\'s tone deaf to what\\'s going on in the world. and have you cooks cut down on the salt - we can add it ourselves at home, but we can\\'t take it out., never again, for sushi they\\'ve been great but everything else...nope not ordering from here again. ordered the orange chicken which on the menu says \"crispy\" orange chicken - it was flavorless mush. seriously it was so nasty i spit it out and threw out the rest. this is really disappointing because this place used to be great and was our go to spot for chinese food but no more. oh and i\\'ve said it for years now but they give you a criminally small portion of rice. like half a cup to go with a quart of food?!! come on now, absolutely the worst food we\\'ve ever had & way overpriced. general tso\\'s chicken, sesame chicken, fried rice, lo mein, and pork egg rolls. the chicken was not breaded & the seasonings were horrible. the \"fried rice\" was brown rice with nothing else in it. the lo mein had absolutely no flavor. the chicken dishes had more broccoli than chicken. the egg roll tasted like marijuana (not a taste that i\\'m fond of).  my husband bit into what looked like a piece of bone. we will never go back again. i wish i could give negative stars, absolutely the worst chinese i\\'ve ever had. i can usually stomach food if it\\'s a little gross but this beef and broccoli was literally inedible even after dousing it in soy. not only that but the wait times for pick up were ridiculous. ordered food at 6:40 and was told 20 mins got to the restaurant at 7:05 and didn\\'t get our food until 7:25! the only reason i give this place two stars is because the crab rangoon was some of the best i\\'ve had. won\\'t ever be back though, there are so many better options in the area., very rude. call to ask where my order was and they were like very dismissive. not very nice during covid i don\\'t think i\\'ll order there again, went last week and it was awful! the place is bad and they don\\'t use fresh food!!! looked in the trash on the parking lot when i left!!! won\\'t return and won\\'t recommend!, we had reservations for 8pm on feb 4. we arrived at 8:02pm. we had our wine opened and ordered a cheese tray for 2 people. we waited for 45 minutes before the \"chef\" who happens to be the owner, john, shows up at our table with the cheese. my husband simply asks john if he feels 45 minutes is reasonable to wait for the first food to come to the table. john gets noticeably angry, proceeds to tell us that he had a problem with his mother-in-law that he needed to handle and get the \"f...k\" out of my restaurant!!!! he proceeded to hold the door open for us!\\n\\nwe have never been treated in such a manner by any business owner! john, you should be ashamed of yourself and you should not be in a customer service oriented business or any business at all!\\n\\nthe food isn\\'t that good, the portions are extremely small and the price is expensive. we will never recommend this place nor their west chester location to anyone. no one deserves to have their evening ruined by some hot headed jerk!, i will say that i feel avalon has some great food. i don\\'t see the benefit in complaining that you were too full and had to take your food home. really?\\n\\nhowever, my big complaint with this restaurant is that they are cash only. you know exactly what that means, right? i think it is horrible business practice to have a cash only restaurant business. what is this, the jersey shore? having a credit card system is necessary and the cost of doing business. their food is not cheap, no reason they cannot have a charge system. \\n\\nadditionally, i have seen many instances where the owner is a bit nutty, and word is starting to get out. in fact, we have heard it so many times that my husband is refusing to eat there anymore. my friend left a review on open table for avalon and the chef called her because he didn\\'t like her review and wanted to argue with her about the service. she liked the food, just not the service. \\n\\nin any case, check it out and decide for yourself. like i said, i think the food is great, but feel the owner has a major problem with his ego. this is going to catch up with him, mark my words.\\n\\n\\n\\n4/18/12-in response to the chef\\'s comments....you didnt always take credit cards. glad you do now! i dont care about the economy and c/c charges. people struggling with the economy do not go to avalon and spend $35 pp on a meal. again, having a charge machine is the cost of doing business and you easily make up the charges by selling soft drinks or dessert. other dtown restaurants, small and large, all have allowed c/c transactions.\\ni stand by the rest of my statements....which are my opinions. learn how to take constructive criticism!\\n\\np.s. check out his facebook page where he complains about customers, uses foul language, and trashes  downingtown borough council, who have always supported his business.  really not professional. can you say anger management?, we had a very bad experience here. chef has a hair trigger- he kicked us out of the place after we dared to complain that service was confusing and we had received a wrong order. he became profane and violent almost punching one of our party. only our server (his daughter)  who stepped in front of him saved this from turning into an assault. i know you think there are always 2 sides to a story, but we honestly were not offensive in any way. i am sure the other diners there who witnessed this could attest to this! \\n\\nthe food is good but not worth the $35 for 4 small plates is pretty steep for the amount of food. this is not \"family style\" as they say, but tapas sized plates not big enough to share.\\n\\nobviously we will never return, but i hope others will avoid this place as well. this man should not be allowed to interface with the public., ate here a while back and was very under impressed. the pizza came out super hot but somehow none of the veggie ingredients were fully cooked. they all tasted mostly raw and the sauce was a little off putting. to top it off 1 pie was over $20. it wasn\\'t the worst pizza we\\'ve ever had but we won\\'t be rushing back here., i was very excited to see santucci\\'s opening up in downingtown as pizza options here are limited in quality.   unfortunately,  santucci\\'s did not live up to the hype and i am sad to report that the food here is ok, but not on my \"go again\" list.   \\n\\nafter a number of false starts (not answering the phone, closing unexpectedly except for the weekend), i was able to secure a pizza. one of us asked on a saturday night, if they did curbside pickup.  that\\'s a no.  how about delivery? no, not tonight, they said.   hmmmmm.   well the one who was going to do the pickup had a broken arm.   this resulted in a half-hearted \"i\\'m sorry,\" that was essentially a \"tough taffies\" response.   so, on a night with an able bodied person in tow, we picked up our order in the 20 minutes we were told it would be ready.   it was.\\n\\nwe ordered the 12 boneless wings.   we got the bone-in ones.\\nthe mozzarella sticks were tasty, but cold ( we are 5 minutes away by car).\\nwe ordered two pizzas: a traditional with pepperoni and a small margherita.   \\nthe crust is thin with the sauce on top of the cheese but also on top of the pepperoni which did not have direct exposure to the heat and did not crisp up.   the margherita had a slice of anemic tomato in addition to the fresh mozzarella and the sauce and was not edible.   \\n\\nservice at pick up was ok.  the place is freshly renovated ad clean, we ordered the margherita and the pepperoni. neither was very good the price of 48.00 was not worth it. i\\'ll stick with the local pizza shops. doubt i will be returning, tried santucci\\'s pizza yesterday for the first time. we got it for take out and got it home. hardly any sausage on a sausage pizza. picked it up and went directly home, (5-7 minutes away) it was cold when we got home. crust was very hard. i don\\'t know if this was just my experience and i don\\'t know if it\\'s better eating in-house. might try it one more time but who knows., i love takoyaki (octopus balls) and okonomiyaki (japanese pancake) and almost always jump at the chance to order these when i can.  sadly, maru global doesn\\'t know how to make either.  \\n\\ni came here for dinner a while back and when i left, the remains of a half-eaten okonomiyaki lay on the table.  i am a beastly pig, and this for me, is kind of unheard of.  they aren\\'t terribly well staffed here (at least when i came with a group of about 7), so if you order all at once in a large group, it takes quite a while for people to get to eat.  \\n\\nbut on the food side, i ordered an okonomiyaki, and what i got was a pancake with a grainy, doughy texture, that was incredibly oversalted.  the consistency of the takoyaki was similarly off although i can\\'t put my finger on what exactly was wrong.  anyway, suffice it to say that i\\'ve had plenty of great octopus balls and japanese pancakes elsewhere (like in new york, you can find this in the east village in the form of yakitori taisho or, my fav, otafuku, or in philly there\\'s yakitori boy).  this place just doesn\\'t cut it, and i\\'m certain i won\\'t be coming back., maru global is apparently an average starting point for those who have never experienced takoyaki- however i admit that i\\'ve gotten a few raw ones on occassion.\\n\\nalso the food is not exactly cheap, the decor sucks and size of the place leave a lot to be desired., my takoyaki balls were woefully inadequate: it was an undercooked, doughy gelatinous mass with exactly two minuscule pieces of octopus randomly hidden in two of the twelve balls in my order.  what was in the rest of the balls? nothing but the undercooked, doughy gelatinous mass.\\n\\nthe gyudon rice bowl?  it looked like canned cat food over a haphazard pile of rice.  it was slightly more edible than the \"maru ball.\"\\n\\nfinally a comment on nomenclature - there is nothing global about the offerings here.  in fact it represents a niche subclass of japanese street fare.  as the sole representative of this genre of food in philly, i wish it could have made a better showing., this is a review for delivery service only.\\n\\nor rather, lack thereof.\\n\\nlast night, we placed a $40 order for various goodies at approximately 6:30pm. their website stated that maru was open until 9pm on wednesdays, and that they deliver within a 3 mile radius (we\\'re in center city and well within that range).\\n\\n7:30 rolls around. 8pm rolls around. we finally call--and the phone rings, rings, and finally goes to an answering machine, which helpfully confirms their hours (and that they should be open). we call about six or seven times in the next half our, in the blind hope they\\'re just really busy.\\n\\nnot so much.\\n\\nby 8:30 we gave up hope, and ordered from our local chinese place. the icing on the cake will be if they charge our card (they don\\'t open--if they open at all--until 11am today, purportedly)., disclaimer: this was for carryout\\n\\ni can only blame myself for wanting to eat gyudon on a saturday night, and leaving no choice but maru global.  there is a 1% chance i\\'ll be back.\\n\\ngood(s):\\nregular takoyaki - it was okay, but i give it the benefit of the doubt because it\\'s my first time with takoyaki\\nchocolate chip balls - if not for these delicious little desserts, \\n\\nbad(s):\\nchicken katsu - thick, dry, disappointing.\\nmiso soup - meh\\ncrab cake balls - don\\'t get these, you\\'ll regret it.  \\nshrimp balls - bland, mushy, meh\\ngyudon - bland, dry beef.  average quality rice.\\n\\ndon\\'t you hate when you really want to like some place and they just come up short?  i really really do.\\nbut if somehow they start making really good japanese street food, someone please let me know.  i\\'ve nowhere to go to fulfill those needs., never had takoyaki before, but saw lots of videos on youtube, so when my persistent googling of \"tacoyaki\" resulted in maru global, i was thrilled.  salivating for fried squid ball goodness, i ordered up a batch.  fresh off the griddle, i had to wait until the little guys were cool enough to eat (hee, hee, \"little guys\").  the first bite proved mushy to the point of undercooked and somewhat devoid of flavor..  frownie face.  my hopes dashed, i hought maybe this is the way its supposed to be, but judging from comments by folks here who\\'ve had other experiences, it seems that tthis place just don\\'t make a good ball.\\n\\nmaybe the griddle is too hot or the batter recipe needs adjustment?  hope they improve., tried them out for the first time at the night market last night...wanted to do the takoyaki but the line was wayyyy tooo long for that..so i ordered the curry burrito...wow not good at all...will give them another shot in the future., dirty, slow, and under-staffed (though friendly).  food\\'s ok, nothing to write home about., have you ever made zucchini or pumpkin bread that looked really great until you cut into it and discovered the center was a dense glob of undercooked dough? unfortunately, that\\'s the best way to describe the consistency of the takoyaki we were served the second day they were open. a week later nothing had changed.\\n\\nadding to my disappointment was the long wait we experienced to receive such a lackluster final product. for a place that\\'s serving japanese street food waiting twenty to thirty minutes to get your food just doesn\\'t work. \\n\\ni really do hope they can get their act together. takoyaki would be a great addition to the philadelphia food scene. if you\\'ve survived for another month i\\'ll give you another try., it was a rare monday i was in the office and not traveling to someplace where asian food means chinese.  i thought about trying jay\\'s sushi as the reviews are good, but jamie s. had liked maru, and i pretty much trust her food opinion above most others. \\n\\nwell unfortunately i don\\'t share the same opinion on maru global.  i decided to try a few dishes -- sesame vinaigrette on salad?  sounds great -- and the salad itself was the highlight of the meal.  but a vinaigrette by definition should emulsify, and not just be a loose combination of sesame oil and vinegar.  oh well.  \\n\\nbeef curry looked promising -- but was completely oversalted.  now i like salty food and i found this really difficult to eat.  even bites of beef, while very tender, reminded me of that unfortunate taste of dead sea water. \\n\\nso two orders of takoyaki.  i decided to go far from classic -- after my falafel factory experience, i realized i need to be open to the unexpected.  pizza? worth a shot.  and with vegan cheese???  well this was a mistake as the soggy dough was completely devoid of flavor.  had the balls had a bit of a crisp, i might have forgiven them, but alas...no.   the chicken cheesesteak balls were promising, what with a little bit of hoisin(?) and a really good cotjia cheese.  and a couple of them were really good.  and a couple of them had no flavor -- not enough cheese and no sauce.  while i am craving the two really good ones, the four not-so-good balls made me concerned about the consistency of maru.\\n\\ni really wanted to like maru, but alas, this was not a match meant to be..., gave it two shots. \\n1st visit) octopus balls- i get it. fried pizza dough with very little amount of seafood in them.  tasty? nope. worth the amount of money charged? nope.  \\n\\n2nd visit ) curry burrito- if you like flavor, do not order this. i get it, japanese curry is different than indian curry, but come on, this burrito was filled with rice!!!!!!!!!! very little beef! i couldn\\'t believe how crappy that was!! if i wanted a freaking carb overload, i would have eaten a meter long loaf of bread from sarcones. blah not to mention the squirt of sour cream that they add to the burrito. 100% killed the flavor. i completely avoided that side of the burrito and couldn\\'t make it past the first half. i was too filled up from the rice.  \\n\\nboth 1st and 2nd time- the food took a ridiculously long time to make.  i\\'m sorry but i can make a burrito in under 2 minutes. i\\'m pretty sure everyone can. curried beef is something that\\'s going to be premade. you just cant stew beef in 30 minutes, or even pretend that you are! pathetic!\\n\\nalso, its super hot inside the restaurant.\\nat least the awesome waitress/cashier/cook who didn\\'t wash her hands was kind enough to offer ice water at the end of the meal. \\n\\noh, and the lemonades/teas that they serve, would be even better if they offered them with ice!, i was very excited at the prospect of takoyaki and okinomiyaki in philadelphia, but sadly this place just doesn\\'t cut it.  i\\'ve never been to the place itself, but they were one of the vendors at the night market.\\n\\ni arrived at the market around 6:30 and immediately stood in line at maru. they weren\\'t even cooking food at this point because they were \"waiting for something.\"  so i made my rounds and came back not much later.  the short line was painfully slow, when i looked at what was going on there was some white guy making about 6 takoyaki at a time rather than using the entire pan.  i\\'ve been to japan where i\\'ve seen them quickly make dozens at a time to a golden brown perfection.  this was inefficient and undercooked.\\n\\nfor some reason i kept on waiting and after 30 minutes i get to the front--only to find out they are out of octopus!  the one dish they are supposed to serve and they are out of it after about 10 people.\\n\\ni know the night market is busy, and not the same as a restaurant, but this gross mismanagement of time and ingredients proves to me that i do not need to be going here.  combined with all these reviews of undercooked, poor quality food leads me to believe philly won\\'t be seeing kyoto street food anytime soon., completely raw goo, anyone? i had to recook it  at home to make those dough balls at least edible. service is great but the food is just not worth the price, let alone the 30min wait.  it\\'s street food, hello, not a gourmet restaurant-there should be no more than 5 min wait , especially when noone else is in line.  soups are oversalted and too thin. might go back to see if they improved., i just had the worst lunch here that i\\'ve had in a year.  i\\'m not a big fan of japanese snack food anyway, but this was badly prepared; the little balls were not cooked all the way through.  i got six chicken and six shrimp balls, but i couldn\\'t tell which were which.  so i ate my twelve little morsels of gluey paste with unidentifiable lumps in them and then i went up the street and got a ham sandwich.\\n\\nthe snack cost $6.50, and i waited 45 minutes for them to be prepared and served.  i resent the 45 minutes more than the $6.50. \\n\\nwarning to groups: the restaurant seats 12 people total.  it has one table for four people and four tables for two., i never get to review balls.  somehow, it\\'s unprofessional, and something that should be kept quiet.\\n\\nbut now that i have tried maru global, i get to write about balls.  and here goes:\\ni\\'ve had takoyaki on my last trip of japan.  i never thought i could enjoy little octopus balls coated in a bunch of sauces oh-so-much.  but i did.\\nand then i heard a takoyaki shop was opening in philly, and i think i drooled on myself over that thought.\\n\\nso i\\'ll given them points for friendliness and trying to please the customer.  so nice.  to the point that it makes me sad to write this.  but...  \\n\\nthe balls were not good!  the texture was just wrong, it was too doughy.  too much bonito, too little mayo.  just...not...right.  when you only have a few things on your menu, and you are the only place in the city serving it, it better be the best darn balls ever.\\n\\nso, the lesson learned?  never return to gross balls.  the end., we arrived a few minutes early for a 7pm reservation. when we asked for our table, both hostesses looking at their paper, then said they\\'d have to go check and would be back. 5 minutes later, they returned and did not acknowledge us. meanwhile, another large party arrived without a reservation and were told it would be a 40 minute wait. we then heard one hostess say to the other that she didn\\'t want to seat them soon because the kitchen was backed up and people were waiting 40 minutes for their appetizers. so unprofessional.\\nwe walked up again, after they continued to ignore us, and asked about our table. they weren\\'t apologetic when they told us that the girl we spoke to earlier that day was new and never recorded our reservation. they continued to tell us that it would be at least a 20 minute wait before they could put our table together. we got a smug \"i\\'m sorry, but she was new\" and they brushed us off.\\ni really understand that sometimes things just don\\'t go the way they were supposed to and that people make mistakes. however, a little customer service would have gone a long way. offer us some water, or a seat at the bar or say that you\\'re doing everything you can to get us in as soon as possible. they basically blew us off and blamed it on the new girl. \\nneedless to say we left and i will not be returning., horrible...to say they forgot our order is an understatement, took over an hour +++ crazy...fries looked gross and tasted worse...waitress did not know her job and was inattentive!!!!...12 jan 2017 update...when you have to go to the bar to get a drink that is bad !!!   pricey for a burger joint...seems like the owners do not care that a party of 4 couples will never go back again!!!!, came in with my family of three and ordered very simple entree\\'s. the server was nice though had to repeatedly tell us our food was on its way. an hour later after notifying management of our displeasure our meal comes out a cheesesteak,salad, and pasta dish. eager to finally eat they screwed up the pasta dish and by then i was fed up and told them i\\'m not happy and will not eat anything else on there menu. all they did was take that pasta dish cost off the check. that is very unacceptable customer service. i would be very careful about going to this establishment. unacceptable!!!, only reason this place is getting two stars is because of their friendly service, everything else was horrible. there\\'s a bullet hole through one of the front windows and at the table we were seated at there were 2 decomposing flies that have become apart of the wall art. we ordered an appetizer that came out pretty quickly, so quick it beat our drink order. we then waited 40 minutes for a medium burger and a bowl of chili. the burger was a \"design your own burger\" where you choose your meat and various toppings that won\\'t come on it when you receive it, but still be charged for it. the chili had good flavor but was too cold to consume so i boxed it, hoping to reheat it later., horrible!!!!   went out for a date night tonight  (monday) and after waiting for more than 45 minutes for our appetizer of the \"jumbo wings\", which were not even what i would consider small, they came out half raw.  if i could give this place a no star rating i would. it\\'s one of the worst places i\\'ve \"eaten\" in the quakertown area. i would definitely not recommended this place. \\n\\nwent to the bathroom and it was dirty, looked like it hadn\\'t been cleaned all night. \\n\\ncan\\'t say much for the waitress because we hardly saw her, only to take our order, bring us our drink and then 45 minutes later to bring us the half cooked wings.\\n\\ndon\\'t go here. you\\'ll experience the same i\\'m sure., horrible...must have forgot our order-to say took forever is an understatement ...fries look gross and taste worse...most of menu look unappetizing... service did not know what the hell she was doing...inattentive!!!, this place is hit or miss.  i\\'ve been here several times and each time at least 1 person i dined with did not like their meal.  i\\'ve experienced lukewarm food, frozen hummus, soggy fries and their homemade ketchup is not hitting the mark.  the last 2 times that i was there (in the past 2 months) our servers were incredibly slow (the restaurant wasn\\'t even full) and insufficient.  1 of the 2 times i had to go to the bar to get myself a 2nd beer after already waiting 25 minutes without even seeing our waitress.  on the positive side, the restaurant offers a nice atmosphere, their wings are killer, the southwest salad is awesome and the burgers are great!!!, i have been to fries several times and have really enjoyed their unique menu. the food was always freshly prepared and the portions were appropriate for the price. my husband loves the beer selection too. \\n\\nhowever, my last visit, and arguably the most important, was a huuuuuge disappointment. you see, i gave birth earlier this month to my second child. i had a mean craving for a burger and fries was the first to come to mind. i ordered the autumn harvest burger and my husband ordered the stinger. we picked it up to bring home to eat. it smelled like heaven and i couldn\\'t wait to devour it. \\n\\nwhen we got home and unpacked the food we both sat down to take out first bite. after we did we both looked at each other in disappointment. is your burger burnt? my husband asked. yup, i said. and your fries too? yup, i said. i coulda cried right there!! how did this happen?! there was only like 2 people at the restaurant. they weren\\'t busy at all. how could they serve us burnt burgers and fries?!?! uggggg....all i wanted after giving birth was a delicious, juicy burger and fries failed me. it\\'ll definitely take me a long time to get over this., i have been coming to fries off and on for the last year, and friday was by far the worst experience i have had this far. friday night, i expected to wait for a table so we sat at the bar and had a beer. the bartender was polite, attentive and extremely knowledgeable. after only a 15 minute wait my boyfriend and i were seated. we were informed of the new menu and ordered a burger and a grilled cheese both with fries and began to wait. and wait. and wait. 45 minutes and we still didn\\'t have food. i can\\'t believe that even with the excuse of a new menu that it would take 45 minutes to make a burger and grilled cheese. after asking 2 times to check on the order it was delivered with half a shrug and the waitress left quickly. as for the wait time, the staff offered us free desert to make up for it! very kind. we asked to take it to go seeing that by the time we had our meals, we shoveled them down and could not fit anymore food! we then waited another 30 minutes for desert!!! the way to make up for a long wait is not to make someone wait even longer!! i was beyond mad and had to ask 2 times what was taking so long. a man finally came out from the back and dropped the bag on out table without a word. how incredibly rude. we have waited over 2 hours now for a \"quick\" dinner and we were brushed off like we didn\\'t matter. it is going to be hard to convince me to return, even though the beer selection is the best in quakertown., the food is so good. we have been here many times for dinner and sunday brunch. we have never been disappointed with the food or the mimosas! however, god forbid you need to be somewhere that day.... do not come here. the service is reliably and consistently awful. waitresses disappear and cannot be found, don\\'t bring drinks or things you ask for, bring the wrong drinks, etc. every single time it\\'s the same thing. we sit and stew (without drinks) and swear we won\\'t be back and then the food comes and all is forgiven!, stopped in for late lunch yesterday. wings and soup. did not like the soup so the server removed it and credited me. the wings were almost inedible as they were so hard and dry\\nate about half. were not good. the asian sauce was to my liking. the next table did have some good looking sandwiches so if i return it will be for a sandwich.\\n\\nfrom the reviews i would believe that this was an incident and not a pattern but i will be cautious., after the great reviews i was looking forward to trying this place out. pub food is always fun. until now. i am so disappointed. when trying a new place i usually stick with the standards to allow a fair comparison.  i tried a standard cheese steak, my wife tried the chicken corn chowder and pulled pork. i has 2 different beers, my wife had a gin and tonic. pretty basic fare.  all the food was dry and tasteless. the rolls were barely fresh the meat spares the colé slaw bland. but how do you screw up fries a a place call fries rebellion?  even a sauce could not cheer them up. and did imention the food was very dry and tasteless?  just want to make sure i made that point. the chicken corn chowder was mostly a yellow broth with barely any veggies or chicken. obviously skimmed from the top of the pot. she left over half the soup and we left most of the fries.  just not worth eating. my wife said her drink was far more tonic than what is usually served. my first beer - a stout came in a mini sniffer glass. not a lot of liquid. my second was a different beer that came in a tall but skinny glass but at least it was enough to drink.  i was interested in what i would be charged for these beers since no pricing was posted.  but when the bill arrived there was no itemize accounting, just a grand total to be paid.  needless to say, there are too many good places to eat in the area, this one is definitely not on that list. do yourself a favor and look for some flavor. it is not here., stopped in here to watch eagles game. be warned: all the tvs in here are no hd. terrible for watching sports. guess i won\\'t be back here to watch sports again. can\\'t even read the down and distance on the fuzzy televisions., too early to tell with this place as of yet. time will tell. they need to rotate beef stock more ..., i bought a gift card for this place on half off the valley and figured we would give it a try so today we decided to make the 20 mile drive to this restaurant. we sat at the bar and the bartender was very helpful and friendly while my boyfriend was deciding on a beer choice. i ordered the cream of crab and herb soup and i was really disappointed. first of all it looked like clams in the soup, not crab, and nowhere on the menu description did it mention it contained peas, carrots and corn in the soup. it was a cross between crab bisque, manhattan clam chowder and vegetable soup. i didn\\'t even eat it because i hate peas. i got the appetizer sampler and there was no way my wings were hot and honey flavor, i believe they were a traditional mild sauce. everything on my sampler was very salty. my boyfriend had the asiago cheese steak and again nothing to praise but again very salty. very little meat in the sandwich. we tried it hoping for better food but we will not go back., my husband and i have been to fries many times, and it was one of our favorite restaurants.  our visit last night however was not a good experience at all.  i ordered the surf and turf burger which is supposed to come with scallops on top of the burger, and it is somewhat expensive for a burger at $14.  the burger had 1 scallop on top, but the worst part was the scallop was bad.  it had the most disgusting smell you could tell it was bad, i pulled it off and basically paid $14 for a cheeseburger with old bay on it.  the fries were also disgusting, they were soggy and under cooked.  i did let our waitress know of the problem, but we were not offered any kind of compensation.  i also overheard the couple next to us, who had ordered the hummus.  i overheard them explain to their waitress that they had ordered it many times in the past and not had a problem, but that this time the hummus was bad and tasted fermented.  i have spoken with some coworkers today that also stated to me that they have recently had problems at fries.  it seems to me that they have gone downhill in the last few months, it is really disappointing., i stopped here for a beer one day and really liked the atmosphere and the menu was interesting. so i decided to go back for dinner last friday night 10/23/2015. i had a beer at the bar as my wife and i waited for our table and we really enjoyed the live music. after we sat down i said to my wife that i really like the place and was enjoying everything. so i decided to order a burger and fries, \" fries rebellion\". the food came out and i was disappointed because the fries were cold and soft. the roll on the burger was cold like it was taken out of the freezer and thawed quickly, not only that but the roll fell apart as i was eating it. my wife said to me this place is called fries rebellion and the fries are cold., just nope. if you like places where the owner is drunk and loud on a weekday afternoon check it out! if you\\'d like to hear your own conversation go somewhere else.\\n\\nwait staff looks miserable. bartender seemed uncomfortable with the situation in general. the food is great, so if the chefs are reading this you guys should run somewhere, anywhere, else. fast. your talent is being wasted., i would give it 2-1/2 stars but that\\'s not an option on my phone. anyway, i\\'ve been wanting to come here for a while and we finally got here. this place seems like it\\'s got everything going for it till you actually try the food. everything we had is forgettable. nothing really stood out. overall the atmosphere is good and wait staff was decent but the actual service was slow. more than likely won\\'t be back., flies!!! close the kitchen door!!! was enjoying our first visit when our dining room began to fill up with flies! food was pretty good until then but when all you can envision are flies sitting all over your food and the ingredients used to make your food, it doesn\\'t much matter how it tastes! when we left we drove around the back and far side of the building to get onto rt 309 and sure enough, the kitchen door was standing wide open. had plans to go there for lunch with my sister tomorrow, but will be going to brick tavern instead. wish all you restaurants would get it through your heads that it does matter if you have nasty, disease carrying flies sitting all over your food ingredients and customers have to fight them off of their food! yes it\\'s summer...you can keep them out by keeping the kitchen door closed!, one of the worst meals we ever had everything was overcooked and burnt . waitress was good cold beer kid friendly 1 out of six meals was cooked properly, went there with my wife after hearing lots of good things, very dissapointed, fries were soggy and mushy, i did not like them, my wife got some kind of pasta, it was very bland. we ordered fried pickles, liked the pickles themselves, but the batter was no good and couldn\\'t cling to the pickles, the sauce they have us to dip them in was no good either, the only thing we got that we thought we good was the steak, the steak was seasoned perfectly and cooked perfectly, the steak is the only reason i am giving this place a 2 instead of a 1, service was slow even though we were some of the only people there, and the waitress screwed up our order. i\\'m willing to forgive bad service, and sometimes even bad food, but a lot of bad food combined with bad service usually does it for me. got a gift certificate for fries rebellion a few weeks ago, i politely declined the gift certificate., not impressed. first visit was okay, not memorable. so, tonight my husband and i decided to give this place another try. everyone has a bad day now and then, right? still not impressed. the menu is very limited in choices. while all the staff is friendly and helpful, they did not get our order correct. i ordered a burger with lettuce and tomato and got a burger with bacon and cheese. i was brought some mayo that looked like it had been sitting for a while. my burger was cooked to mw as asked, but really had no flavor. my husband had the abomination burger and said the pulled pork was dry. the most memorable moment about tonight\\'s meal was when the honey dipper showed up and started pumping out the septic in the middle of our meal. the smell just ruined the end of a disappointing meal. couldn\\'t get out of there fast enough., based on the other reviews, we decided to check out fries.  we made a reservation and were seated promptly.  i ordered a margarita.  i realize this is a beer joint but seriously, this is the number one mixed drink ordered by women in this country.  i asked for it \"up with salt\" - it came in a sour glass with ice and was clear and disgustingly strong.  i decided to bite my tongue and just not order another.  if a bartender cannot make a margarita, they should not be bartending.  next came the meal - cold.  the flavor was probably there but who could tell.  bad drinks and cold food.  probably will not visit again., i have been here a hand full of times, and ive never been impressed enough to come back. i always see this place empty. unless its the people that are there for drinks. \\nthats something they usually get right.  the food is eh. i tend to skip out of hang out sessions if theyre at this place. sorry., when they first opened, the quality of the food and service were great. sometime in early to mid 2017, things began declining. the food quality went from being rave-worthy to so-so and the servers, though nice enough, just can\\'t seem to get the orders right any more. it\\'s very disappointing. i hope they\\'re able to turn things around soon., i used to love george\\'s wings. i ordered from them this weekend and it has gone downhill. their boneless wings aren\\'t good anymore. giant pieces of chicken and the chicken is gross. too much breading and drowned in sauce. the girl at the counter was extremely rude to us as well. i\\'m disappointed they were one of my favorite places but i will not order from them again., nothing special really. \\n\\nthis place is around the corner from my apartment and i\\'ve wanted to try it for a while. i ordered 10 medium wings. i chose to pickup, so i sat inside and waited. it was a reasonable wait. \\n\\nabout 10 minutes go by and they announce that 10 mild wings are ready. i continue to wait. they give the order to another customer and then she turns to me and says i think this is your order because i should have more wings than this. she returns the wings to them. there was then some bickering behind the counter and then someone turns to me and says this is your order. i stated 10 medium wings and they assured me oooo yes 10 medium wings.\\n\\nthey were no where near medium. there was barely any sauce on them at all, it was all in the bottom of the container. \\n\\ni doubt i\\'ll go back, i was not impressed with the wings at all. very disappointing for a place with wings in its name. they weren\\'t cooked well and where slimy. the sauce was pretty good but that\\'s all i can say about them. slimy, used to be a lot better. the food is good but they close at 10 and on several occasions we have called at 920-930 and they refused to take our order. also constantly forgetting the sauces which are the reason we order the chicken!!, really disappointed in the boneless wings. dropped $25 through grub hub for 15 wings and fries. didn\\'t realize i clicked boneless, but hey, all good. sadly, the boneless wings tasted like frozen nuggets put through the microwave then drown in sweet baby rays bbq sauce. i\\'d like to give their regular wings a chance in the future but now, i advise against the boneless wings., small wings like micro dwarf sized wings that they charge over a dollar each for them lol. yeah they taste fine but completely not worth it at all. sad, very poor customer service. i believe it\\'s the owners son who has no respect for customers or staff from what i can see. being someone respectful to others, being disrespected in a establishment is humiliating. very uncomfortable feeling and situation. i did not at all appreciate aggressiveness and the tone that i was being spoken to in. being in customer service i understand the right and wrongs the should be precautioned when dealing with customers and clients & from my experience it was completely unprofessional of someone who owns a business. it would\\'ve been acceptable had it been respectful., placed a order today at 8:38pm on their website, for a simple order of 15 wings. said it would take about an hour.  around 9:52pm we realize we made the order so we check the site.  it says delivered! but yet no wings are in my hands.  so i run down stairs to the front door, and after waiting for 5 min, i go back upstairs. only for my girlfriend to tell me they now canceled the delivery!   \\n\\nnow we\\'ve waited an hour, no food, and now everything in the area is closed because it\\'s past 10pm.. \\n\\nbut wait! there\\'s more! not only did we not get our food but they kept the payment too!  and they would not answer the phone the 30+ times we called.  \\n\\nloved their wings,  but i will never give them a cent of my money again!, this place used to be good back when it was called mr. wings. wings were soggy and slimy. too much sauce. it\\'s a shame the wings are good sized. corn on the cob was overcooked in a styrofoam container half full of butter water that spilled all over in bag. garden salad was ok as well as fries. no celery with wings. for a place that uses wings in the name of their business the wings are pretty disappointing. this is the second time i was really disappointed in the wings. i decided to give them another try. you are better off with wingstop across the street. i won\\'t be back., i never leave bad reviews ever or rarely ever leave reviews in general, but was so taken back with their customer service today. we\\'ve been going here for a while and always place good sized orders and i always tip a few dollars even on takeout, last few times we ordered platters all the sides were together in same styrofoam carton and the broccoli juice & butter have been drenching the fries and chicken making it mushy and tasting horrible like straight butter....no huge deal so i thought as we\\'d start asking for the broccoli separately when we order it, the last few times we ordered sides separately it still didn\\'t come separate and today when i placed an order and asked for the broccoli to be separate from the chicken and fries they said they cannot do that, i asked again if they could just not put it in the same container (seems the girl then asked another person nearby) and then said no they can\\'t, so i said i\\'d have to cancel my order then and they said ok, haha crazy! i thought i was making a very basic request and wasn\\'t asking for much as i just don\\'t like butter getting on my fries and chicken, but for some reason they just wouldn\\'t accommodate that. it\\'s a shame as we liked their chicken and liked to order from here and small businesses in general. what makes it even weirder is that a salad comes with the platter and i tell them i don\\'t want the salad so if it\\'s about them not wanting to give me another container it\\'d actually even itself out as i don\\'t take the salad. just overall bad business, i am so so so disappointed in our wings tonight. we used to order from here alot so we figured lets give them a call for some wings! i have had a long day at this point and starving so i would eat anything at this point, however our wings were literally un edible! i work at a place that sells wings so i know a bad wing. my wings were clearly pre cooked then when ordered cooked again and fried hard. literally the meat was barely left on them and the skin was so crunchy and hard i legit couldn\\'t chew it. i felt like bringing them right back after they were delivered. i hate to write this review but i just don\\'t want anyone else left without a meal because your wings were not edible., im totally disgusted and never ordering from here again. they are not only overpriced but they are filthy! i found an eyelash last time i ordered from work. i gave them the benefit of the doubt but after finding a long black hair on my wrap i\\'m  done with them and so are my coworkers. tell your staff to wear hairnets!!!!, i ordered 25 wings and only received 20. not a huge deal but when the wings are almost a dollar each it adds up. plus, i ordered 25 to split 10 and 15 with another person. when i called an employee (female) got on the phone and asked me (in a condescending tone) if i was sure and implied that i was wrong about my count. she stated that the cook said they checked it before it went out so there was no way for her to know for sure. i have an extensive order history with them and have never had an issue before so now to have one and have it implied that i was wrong, when the 20 wings were laying right in front of me, was a little insulting. as if i would call them to try and get 5 free wings from them. so instead of just sending me my wings i was offered a 5 dollar credit for a future order. i will never order from them again. there is a right way to treat a customer and then there is george\\'s way., their chicken ceasar salad cost me $5.66. its a side salad with only lettuce, croutons and chicken and there wasn\\'t even parmesan cheese.  their excuse for why such a small salad at a high price was its a quality salad.  bullshit for a $1 more i can get a regular size salad with parmesan cheese and eggs from the works.  thats what a real chicken ceasar salad is., used to be my favorite, now they are overpriced tiny wings. as my man trump would say ..... sad!, no longer liking china king.  now that abacus delivers, we no longer get china king.  \\nthe food quality is okay.  we had a couple of pretty weak dishes.  used to like the hunan chicken and hunan shrimp.  but last couple of times we ordered, we were disappointed in the quality and flavor., the food here is terrible (old-tasting, not warm at times). takeout is packaged in leaky styrafoam plates. the prices are average, and there are many places in lansdale that are better (i prefer golden chopsticks) - atmosphere is average at best. would not recommend., by far thee absolute worse shrimp and broccoli (chinese food) i\\'ve ever tasted. the brown sauce taste like water, brown water the thought alone makes me cringe. i also had an order of general tso shrimp which wasn\\'t too bad which is why i gave it 2 stars. the man who answered was rude too and for a saturday it wasn\\'t busy in there and only one person working. i can see why. stay far away, we chose this place because the menu said \"we deliver faster\". an hour later i called to see where our food was and was told \"we are busy maybe next time.\" when the food arrived, the chicken was all dried out and leathery. the wonton soup was also inedible. two thumbs down!, this is the third local take out i\\'ve tried and it ranks at the bottom. i\\'ll stick with one of the other two in the future. the ribs had the oddest taste of sausage to them which i can\\'t even begin to understand and likely wouldn\\'t want to know either. the fried dumpings were bland at best even after soaking them in the sauce. the picture of the place looks a lot better than what i saw. maybe it was just the daylight but looked dark and dingy at night., first and last time eating here. served on paper plate with little plastic spoon and fork. egg roll not even on a plate but in a little bag. wontons were so over cooked i could not even cut them with the little spoon. no hot tea offered. soup severed in a take out plastic bowl. hunan beef ok but beef very chewy., started a new job in the area and wanted some chinese. picked up some lunch from here and almost threw up afterwards. will not return!, lets start with the physical part first. the windows are absolutely filthy. the handle on the men\\'s room door is broken so if you need to take a dump expect company!! the temperature is set at 60 degrees. i felt like i was in a meat locker!\\n\\nnow for what they call food. i ordered scallops in garlic sauce extra spicy not once but twice!! what i got is some scallops in a very mild brown sh-- sauce with no spice whatsoever. the hot and sour soup had no hot or sour in it at all.\\n\\nthe place is a sh--hole stay far far  away!!!!!!!!!!!!, i\\'m so disappointed. ordered for delivery tonight and still no food an hour later. we had to call and cancel. when it comes to delivery, there are no second chances. won\\'t be ordering from here again. :(, food was okay, delivery service was okay, however, management was difficult when discussing a problem with our order. manager accused mom of ordering wrong, but after arguing the point said they would send missing item. they need to work on refining their customer service skills. forty minutes later still waiting for missing item., we dined here a few months ago.  chicken chow mein was too oily (greasy).  the shrimp w/ brocolli was excellent, however.   we went back a few weeks ago with a bogo coupon from the save around national savings book (which is sold by charitable organizations), and the person in charge would not honor the coupon.   it had not expired, but he wouldn\\'t honor it.  so, we chose to go elsewhere., very slow delivery, mediocre overcooked food. many of the reviews i saw on google are obviously fake, with ridiculous fake names. yeah i\\'m sure it\\'s a coincidence that all these google reviewers who all write the same way are also reviewing the same crab du jour restaurants all over the country. not purchasing reviews at all. as you can see below they\\'ve had many fake reviews removed from yelp also. go out of business please., i got severe food poisoning from the food here, i believe it was the wonton soup because no one else i was with ordered the soup. the food was only okay going in, but it was terrible when it left my body. i was severely ill and because of that do not recommend eating here., i used to love this place but in my last order i pulled out 3 hairs from my pizza. that\\'s absolutely unacceptable. i can understand 1, but 3? i used to travel 4 miles to get the pizza here (i used to live nearby and moved and couldn\\'t part with my favorite pizza shop), now i won\\'t return., horrible and greasy. my mom loves it so they always order i got sick every time i have ate there., love the food.... usually. the other week i ordered a chicken and broccoli wrap. \\nthe worse... who made it obviously doesn\\'t know how to wrap a wrap correctly. and the chicken did not taste good. i like their pizza and steaks and hogies and most of the sides i\\'ve tried. all great. just highly disappointed in that wrap., i have wasted too many hours of my life in this \"irish pub\". it\\'s basically a place where dumb business people, stranded travelers and suckers go to eat standard pub food that is overpriced and underwhelming. \\n\\ni was unfortunately a stranded traveler on monday and instead of standing out in the blistering heat where the streets reeked of steaming garbage, i decided to suck it up and head into slainte. \\n\\noh? you want a drink? i hope you have 25 minutes to wait for it. oh, you want some whiz fries? i hope you like fries that are still frozen in the middle. \\n\\nthis place has two redeeming qualities. clean bathrooms and proximity to 30th street station., slainte used to be a fantastic lunch spot, especially since its right across the street from our office and there really hasn\\'t been much around, but it has really gone down hill.  i recently returned after a long hiatus only to see that they revamped their menu and took probably 60% of the items off.\\n\\nthey used to have an amazing turkey burger, but its gone.  in its place?  tacos.  you know, the traditional irish taco.  perfect for an irish pub?  get the heck out of here!  what are they doing?!?! tacos?!?!  smh.\\n\\nthey also used to have amazing daily specials but those seem to be a thing of the past as well.\\n\\nit\\'s too bad.  we used to come here once a week, sometimes more.  now i bet it\\'ll be more like once a month, if that.  there are just too many other options now and the extra walk to them is worth it., cliiiiche. i do love irish theme pubs, but this reminded me of the olive garden of irish-themed pubs.  no real standouts, the same kitchy things stuck around the place as most other places like it.\\n\\nthe only benefit i can see is that it is the fastest place to get a drink prior to getting on a train., this isnt a bar that i have ever heard of people going to because there was a desire to go there, rather more people go as a result of circumstance. \\n\\nliterally the only bar that you can see from 30th, close to center city and in university city. as a result its usually packed for happy hour but dead every other time of been there.\\n\\nin short its overpriced. one dollar off happy hour beers... making a happy hour beer $5-6... what is happy about that. landmark down the street has $3 beers.\\n\\nlunch will cost you $15+.  not really sure what the justification is as there are dozens of food trucks and places with lunch specials in the area.\\n\\nthe service is slow, the bartenders dont seem terribly interested in you, and they do things at thier own pace. \\n\\njuke box is way too loud. when someone picks a song that is all you will hear, somce its an odd mox of patrons get ready for country, screamer music, dirty rap... alternating, at a very high volume., wanted to like it, but ultimately disappointed. went for university city dining days. was looking forward to it. thursday evening at 6:30 pm. it was so loud, couldn\\'t hear the person across the table. not many people in the dining area so seated quickly. waitress came by to take our drink order. took quite a while but got the drinks and they were good. ordered the potato skins appetizer and my husband ordered the chicken quesadilla. both were fine although it took a long time to come out. i ordered fish and chips for my main and it was pretty good. my husband ordered the shepard\\'s pie and it was a joke. i believe there were 4 healthy spoonfuls total. taste was very good but it was small for a side dish much less an entree. we had the bread pudding desert. the ice cream that came on top was very good. \\n\\nthe main complaint was the service. not a lot of people eating and several waitresses, but it was extremely slow service because true waitresses were hanging out at the bar talking and drinking beverages. they were holding plates of food to take  to a table in one hand and drink their beverage with the other. very friendly waitress but they were not very good. had to repeatedly ask for water, the next course, the check and eventually had to flag a manager down to pay. he walked around the corner to the waitress who was by then talking to other people (band maybe?) in the corner. \\n\\nreally disappointed in the service and food was good but portions were small., let\\'s start off with the worst service i have experienced in philadelphia, thus far.  waitress took 10 minutes to get to my table for the first time, another 8 minutes to bring my first diet coke, etc.  i did not get better from there.  the host seemed to be either doing crosswords or something else at the front desk the whole time (my table was 5 feet from there and he offered no help!)\\n\\ni ordered the french onion soup and that was good at a good price.  i ordered the turkey dinner.  now, i love turkey, could eat it everyday, etc.  my plate arrived (after a very long wait and no check in from the waitress) and it looked like a pile of slop like you\\'d see the troops on mash getting in the old days.  the turkey was tasteless, the mashed potatoes were unrecognizable and just a pile of brown stuff.  i have pretty plain taste so it does not take much to impress me.  this food was fit for a dog, at best!\\n\\nbetween the absentee waitress, crosswording host, and slop for food ... i will not be heading back here and i recommend you not even waste your time either.  i should mention this was a tuesday night so no excuse., the food was pretty good and the beer selection was good, just pricey.  the 2 stars are for the lousy service we got.  the hostess just stood around and did nothing while the 1 waitress was preoccupied with watching tim tebow all night.  her loss since she just cost herself tip money, but her poor serving skillz took away from our night just a tad., service seemed nice, though i only did take out. one extra star for the prompt food within 15min, as everyone asks this with a train to catch. the caveat: you will likely have the worst food of your life.\\n\\nsoup of the day was something chicken tortilla, which was only okay and there was no tortilla. the highlight of the meal. from there, it was straight downhill. philly cheesesteak cheap meat not marinated between cheap bland bread - the worst i\\'ve ever had, by far. fish tacos were of the same caliber.\\n\\nshould have went to cosi., i have no complaints about the drink or food selection here. most of the things i\\'ve had have been great. the manager was the definition of cold and aloof. as my friends and i were sitting down at our table the manager comes over and says \"you can\\'t do this\" in a sharp tone. he said we were blocking traffic, but if he would have approached us in a different manner then he would know that we simply moved the table so our friends could squeeze into our seats then slid the table back. \\n\\nhis \"cleaning of the table\" consisted of wiping a few peanut shells off the table. he left the rest of the peanut shells and drink marks on the table. i went up to him and asked if he could spray the table. he said that we didn\\'t allow him the chance to do so.\\n\\nmy main issue is the tone he used. it honestly seemed like he had a bad day and was taking it out on the customers. he took no accountability and sat on his phone in the corner the entire time.\\n\\ni should mention our waiter, mike, helped save my disaster of a night. he was beyond kind and on top of serving us.\\n\\ndidn\\'t feel respected or welcomed, sadly., bar itself isn\\'t horrible or anything. when we went people were butchering karaoke which i\\'m 100% all for - never gonna judge people for having a blast.\\n\\nmy problem with this place was the god-awful bartender joel mchale. as soon as we walked in he started trash talking us? never had that experience before. his service was horrible, and after i complained to another staff member, he came up to us and challenged us to go write him a bad review on yelp.\\n\\nwell, ok joel. here it is. you are the worst bartender i\\'ve ever seen. i\\'ve worked in the industry for a couple years, been to pubs all across this country. and you are absolutely the worst. in a way, that\\'s kind of impressive.\\n\\nbut hey, again,  the actual bar itself isn\\'t bad - just joel mchale., came here hungry and wanting food. stand in the front not one give me a table. they all had an eye problem tho. i was so hungry i wasnt in to the games cause everyone was eating and drinks. it was a snow strom and i did call ahead to see if the kitchen was open cause that i was that fucking hungry. sat at bar while everyone got drinks and food. got up to leave the waiter comes over but to be sure i am leaving. fuck this place., crooks!!!  went to slainte for happy hour.  there were happy hour specials advertised multiple places on menus and printed daily special sheets.  apparently the servers were not aware of these specials.  from 5-7 there were $5 appetizers, $1 off all drafts, and i think $0.50 off wine.  also all day on wednesday there was a special drink for $3.50 for some black cherry jim beam.  \\n\\ngot the bill and no happy hour prices were used.  everything was full price from apps to drinks.  asked the server to fix the bill because of this error, comes back with $3.50 off the tab - when at least $12 should\\'ve been taken off and had already run the tab on my friend\\'s card.  \\n\\nreally wanted to like this place because of its convenience, but will never go back when someone literally steals money from me., the waitress was too slow-we got our water after 15 minutes .also we asked her to give us napkins two or three times and she totally forgot it, came here purely out of convenience, since it\\'s so close to the 30th street station and the megabus pick-up/drop-off. \\n\\nfood was completely fine, not extraordinary, but pretty good for bar food, and the bar/restaurant itself was very clean.\\n\\nunfortunately the waitress we had seemed to be new and super forgetful (i.e. left my friend\\'s bloody mary sitting at the bar for like 10 minutes in plain sight after the bartender mixed it), and the bathrooms were in terrible condition (i remember some duct tape on one of the toilets)., came here after midnight, little disappointed at their banger and mash dish. this had a little green shamrock next to the item on their menu which means it\\'s one of their specialty. but it wasn\\'t great at all. the bangers or sausage tasted like breakfast sausage right from a frozen box. under my four sausage they loaded up on mash potatoes that cover up my plate. i think the dish was to come with side of vegetables, but it was late and they probably ran out. but anyways, basically it was terrible, i should just stick with a burger. the bar was kind of neat, had that old tavern charm and you can get numerous beers from tap. it\\'s right by the amtrak station on 30th street in philly and right next to drexel university. you can stop by here for a drink while waiting for your train ride or order food but don\\'t order their bangers and mash! lol, meh.  food is inconsistent.  not impressed at all., came here with some classmates for the last night of university city dining days.  nice place, rather unassuming entrance, and free, self-serve peanuts at the door!  i had their french onion soup and an order of their old bay fries.  i was pleasantly surprised by the soup--i love french onion soup and typically get it whenever i go to a new place.  slainte\\'s is definitely up there:  cheesy, oniony, beefy, hot, nice consistency, and under $4.  but, alas, it all went downhill from there.\\n\\ni do not consider myself any sort of food snob.  i know good food when i have it, but more importantly, i know bad food when i have it.  simply, the old bay fries were inedible.  the amount of salt used was insane--it was like eating a salt lick.  i had my friends try some, in case it was just me, but they passionately agreed that they were disgusting and inedible.\\n\\nas well as not being a food snob, i\\'m also not a dick when it comes to complaining about crap in a restaurant.  but, on principle, i felt it necessary to notify the back to take it easy on the salt next time (unless this was an isolated incident).  when we paid for our bill, i politely suggested to the server as such.  i didn\\'t necessarily expect to get comp\\'d or anything, but i certainly did not expect sass.  i tell him to try one, he declines and proceeds to tell me that \"well, you know, fries usually come with salt and pepper.\"  thanks, jackass, i know that.  \"and, old bay seasoning has salt in it and stuff.\"  um, yeeeah, i know what old bay tastes like--that\\'s why i ordered it.\\n\\none bonus star for the french onion soup and peanuts., i have heard of this restaurant before and decided to go for a late lunch i work around the corner. first thing i noticed was there was no one at the door to greet me so i ended up sitting my self , finally when i was noticed my waitress asked what i would like to drink but never brought me a menu after getting my drink i looked over the menu witch seemed average for pub food, i ordered the hickory burger with sweet potato fries . to my amazement the burger was cooked very well and very tasty but my fries were cooled. the service definitely lacked it seemed as though they were more concerned with socializing with the staff. i wouldn\\'t recommend this restaurant neither will i be coming back!!, ate here as an alternative to 30th street station fare on a two hour stop-over. cannot recommend at all for the food. turkey dinner is more like 3-4 smal pieces of turkey on one piece of toast. the turkey was good, but was less than an appetizer portion. the waitperson also got my order wrong as i ordered the additional ceasar, but she substituted the salad for the mashed. the salad was over dressed with way too much vinegar in the dressing; and the roll was stale. i then ordered the mac and cheese, which looked ok and the crumb topping was hot from the salamander, but then the center was still refrigerator cold. at least the iced tea was good, the staff was helpful and the beer selection looked good, but all in all, a culnary disaster., i can\\'t rate their food but i can rate their customer service. \\n\\nnew to the area. wanted to place an order for delivery we are just 8mins away (2.8miles). the women who answered the phone admitted she didn\\'t know the area that well and had to ask another employee if we were in range. she then punched in the address into the system as we were trying to explain that it\\'s a new street located closest to the intersection of arcola rd and troutman rd but it was to late the results were in and she said \"your out of range.  out of range!? \\n\\nvinnie\\'s, every new resident in the complex is given your laminated to go menus!, some of the worst pizza i\\'ve ever had. the crust was soggy and weak, the pizza itself is pretty bland. we got take-out and had to put it in the toaster oven to dry out the crust. i\\'ve had better frozen pizza. too many good places to waste money here again.\\n\\nunless you want a hot dog, or some interesting mac and cheese., shortly after opening, the restaurant closed and displayed \\'closed for renovations\\' signs in their windows. now, it\\'s an abandoned building.  not sure what happened but this eatery is officially closed!, this place sucks.went here the other week this place is a joke. the pizza taste like rubber and the sauce has some weird bitter vinegar taste. and for bad food they are very expensive., first time i went, about a week after they opened and banging mac n cheese, pretty good pizza! last two times was awful!! pies were burnt and the sauce was lacking, had the mac and cheese again and my stomach was hurting all night. the only reason they got 2 stars was how good that first experience was. i will not be going back. it\\'s too bad because it\\'s a great location, i really wanted this place to stay tasty., decided to come by with my niece and girlfriend for late night milkshakes. let\\'s say from here on out i\\'ll be going anywhere but stargate. when i called in the hostess was rude and seemed annoyed, i was met with the same feeling when we arrived. the hostess seemed annoyed that we didn\\'t want to sit and just wanted milkshakes to go. we were handed menu anyway which didn\\'t even have milkshakes on them. the workers were rude and dirty. i felt like i was in a drug rehab. not to mention the milkshakes were plain and watery and overpriced. $5-6 a piece. springfield diner is leaps and bounds better, okay food, good prices, but you literally have to beg for a refill of coffee! and don\\'t sit at the counter- they do their side work there and stack dirty dishes and spray bottles of detergent right next to you while you eat! also- the staff  spends all their time gossiping with each other about their baby\\'s fathers, wildwood, and tv shows while you sit there waiting for service!\\nalso- the atmosphere is lousy. feels like you\\'re eating in a dentist office waiting room!, such a shame!! for year, this place was our go-to place for a yummy, quick, simple meal. unfortunately, recent changes have really taken the place to a new-low. \\n\\na few months ago the drop off was noticed. for instance, i ordered a piece of chocolate cake to finish off an \"ok\" meal (husband\\'s dinner wasn\\'t prepared correctly). the cake was clearly old- the entire side of it was hard. when i told the waitress the problem, she showed it to the manager who effectively told me there was nothing wrong with it. i told him to eat it but i\\'d not be paying for it- regardless of whether they\\'d take it off the bill (which the waitress did eventually). \\n\\nhoping this was a one-off, we\\'ve returned several times since then and each time either the food isn\\'t good, or the prices are inconsistent. yesterday sealed the deal when we wound up being charged $4.50 for a single blueberry pancake! (yes only 1!)  ($3.25 for a single pancake is insane to start off with but then hit with an extra $1.25 for about 12 blueberries.) when i mentioned this to the person at the register, i got no response or acknowledgement of the issue at all. \\n\\nso, not only is the product inferior, the prices higher, but the management is choosing to do nothing to rectify issues with their (formerly) loyal clientele. there are other restaurants just down the street that will now get our business. \\n\\nthree strikes and your out stargate. we will not be back., 5:43 am friday, not open, says 24 hours but again mislead by out of date information on yelp, what a horrible little place. never got the chance to try the food because we were made to wait for an inordinate amount of time at the door, even though clean tables were available. staff even lied to us and told us no tables were available. i sure hope this experience had nothing to do with skin color., i\\'ve been here twice and it was like night and day. the first time, service was quick, my breakfast came exactly as i ordered and i went on my way. \\nthe next time? omg. i ordered the exact same thing and the cook could not get my eggs right.   i\\'m very specific about how i like my eggs and after three failed attempts, i said forget it. \\neggs over medium well people. no runny whites or yolks and i like my yolk moist!  (i know, i\\'m worse than most starbucks divas when it comes to my eggs). surely am experienced breakfast chef can figure it out. \\nthe waitress was kind but slow. she tried but when the hashbrowns weren\\'t crispy, as ordered, it was time to go. \\n\\nhit or miss on your eggs., was on my way to philadelphia airport and i decided to stop at a diner being from the west coast i like to do that when i\\'m in town.  i walked then was told to sit anywhere and then i became invisible because the same person that told me to sit anywhere then seated several other groups of people and gave them menus and served them and never acknowledge me at all. so, i left and went mcdonald\\'s., while my take-out experience was good, my sit-down experience was terrible.\\n\\nthe service was awful. i mean, beyond awful. the restaurant wasn\\'t even full and it was still awful.\\n\\nour waitress took forever to get our drinks, and our food took a half an hour to come out (come on, it was just a couple sandwiches). we also didn\\'t have enough place settings at the table and when we asked for napkins we never got them. i just couldn\\'t believe how terrible the service was. they seriously had to try to be so bad.\\n\\nthat being said, the food was just fine, and the french fries were just as good as before. i guess i\\'ll stick with take out., wish there is zero star. first, they dropped the plate and trashed my french toast. amazingly, neither the waitress and manager said a single word to apologize. then the waitress took my order wrong, did not listen to what i said and end up charging me a lot more than i expected. then i asked the manager the french toast does not taste right, he gave me a bad attitude. i\\'m surprised how can they get their rating for such bad service and emergency management. they might be paying for ratings. anyway, way over priced food and terrible service. if you have better options, do not go there. i\\'m never going back for sure., stopped in last night for dinner, first time we have been there, last time too. server was friendly but food was not good. my husband had the fish, generous portion but lying in oil and cold can string beans. i had grilled chicken also generous portion but with tasteless mashed potatoes that were thick and chunky and the same mushy green beans. needless to say, we said no to coffee and dessert and paid the bill and left....btw i think prices run a bit higher than some other diners in area with better quality., went this morning i wouldn\\'t say i had a great experience.  i wasn\\'t even acknowledged as someone needing a table and when someone finally came over they asked for the people behind me and never acknowledged i was waiting.  next the food.  the omelet was dried out potatoes not cooked enough and toast was not toast just warmed bread., used to be a great place, until the recent rennovations.  food was reliably good to very good, service was friendly, prices were reasonable and portions were fairly generous.  the past few months have seen some changes, though, after some fix-ups and improvements in the place, along with a new menu that\\'s trying - and failing - to camoflage a basic hole-in-the-wall diner as if it were a real restaurant.\\n\\nthey\\'re trying to be a \"real restaurant\" instead of a neighborhood diner, and they\\'re making mistakes.  no doubt the rennovations were costly : new lighting, replacing the water-stained ceiling panels, new tile work, maybe a couple other less visible improvements.  some crackpot accountant must have told the owners to recover the costs by raising prices, reducing portions and skimping on service.  and boy, did they fall for that bad advice.\\n\\nprices are much higher with the \"new\" menu, now including way overpriced appetizers.  the menu expanded a little, but it\\'s all still basic diner food, and not substantially better (or worse) quality than it\\'s been for years ... just 15%-20% more expensive than the old menu.  is a 10-inch hoagie that rates a 6 or 7 out of 10 worth $8 plus tip when you can get a bigger & better hoagie at the local deli or corner pizza shop for a similar price (or less) ?  how good does a $7+ cheesburger have to be when you can get as good a sandwich at mickey d\\'s for almost half that ?\\n\\nportion sizes are also down : smaller servings of veggies, about half the fries you used to get with many meals, and noticably more ice & less beverage.  soup\\'s served in smaller bowls and the dessert portions are now thin enough to read a newspaper through.\\n\\nservice isn\\'t what it used to be, either.  friendly, efficient wait staff has had more serious turnover than usual.  apparently, the hiring standards have dropped way down - no doubt along with the pay, i\\'d bet.\\n\\nif you\\'re desperately hungry and don\\'t mind overpriced, only-slightly-better than mediocre food and gum-snapping, slow wait staff, the stargate diner is worth a try.  otherwise, drive on and you\\'re sure to find someplace better., wow!  come in the place, sit down, and the table is spoiled.  the menu\\'s are spoiled.  the plates are spoiled.  the glasses are spoiled.  silverware? spoiled.  waitress? spoiled.  clientele? spoiled.  aluminum foil?  foiled., service slow and food quality has slipped. waited a long time to get served and the food was nothing to write home about., i came in a little inebriated  it thinking i was going to find out greasy spoon but this is just horrible not worth it stop keep it moving, the staff was so nice but this food was horrible!!!!! it was such a disappointment! usually diner food is lowkey good but not this one. crab dip had way too much cheese. and they let philly down with the worst cheesesteak i ever had! the only thing good was the fries, the worst experience i\\'ve ever had at a restaurant, and i have eaten out a lot. at first, we were impressed by our server\\'s friendliness and attentiveness. he helped us select our wine, and gave us samples before pouring our glasses. but then, it went all downhill from there. the server did not return to our table for at least 30 mins. we put in our order, which was just simple paninis. you\\'d like that would be a quick order. time ticks by. and by. and by. we didn\\'t get our food til nearly an hour later. and what arrived what paltry, to say the least. literally, two slices of prosciutto, a bit of lettuce, and some cheese on bread. when we finally were able to get our server\\'s attention again, we told him with unabashed honestly how we felt. apparently, there were problems in the kitchen and our server had to spend time cooking. but, there were also other staff around. it made no sense that his time had to be so compromised. he told us dinner is on him. we left him a few bucks for the wine, and left. we will not be back there anytime soon. and i don\\'t expect di vino to last even that long., quite possibly the worst chinese food i\\'ve ever had. salted squid was more salt than squid to the point where the salt was salted. the fried shrimp dumplings were more like fried shrimp wontons and had a bad after taste suggesting the oiled they were fried in probably wasn\\'t too new. the sizzling beef was a disappointment. lastly we got a coconut/pineapple smootie that was basically ice wand watered down pineapple juice. sucks paying good money for bad food but chinatown or at least a few spots on castor ave in ne are worth the drive than the annoyance., hostess did not even say hello just put wrapped utensils down walked away. i ordered egg drop soup it was way too thick for me. i also ordered chicken  & black bean sauce it was ok more onions and green peppers then chicken. i would not return to this place., disappointed with the food here! was excited to try it but it was a huge let down! place was very clean though!, recently moved to the area and my wife and i are trying new take out locations.  we found hong kong star online and gave it a try.  not good, not good at all.  my wife tried their red curry and it tasted like garlic sauce and was very runny.  they tried to tell me over and over again that this was thai red curry.  well, it\\'s not.  i guess the one good thing is they refunded me on the spot.  won\\'t ever go back there again., horrible. literally the worst takeout i\\'ve ever had. i ordered the korean beef noodle soup. i asked for extra spicy. not only was it not spicy but also flavorless and not worth 10$. the wonton soup was basically all broth and no wontons and the egg rolls were awful. don\\'t waste your time or money on this place., horrible service and food is just okay. they always forget items from our order, but still charge you. when you call back, the lady always argues with you and never wants to take responsibility.\\nwe will find another place to order for office lunch.\\nnot worth it!, have tried this place quite a few time for delivery. i get the same thing each time.  fried shrimp wonton and general tso\\'s chicken. i decided to eat in this time. ordered the same thing. i found it kinda odd that the fried shrimp wonton had a burnt taste to it. there was no appearance like it was burnt, just had that taste. so i received the general tso\\'s chicken. that had a burnt taste to it too. i called for the waitress and informed her of this matter. i told her it taste like it was cooked in burnt oil. she told me it was fresh oil. i was thinking to myself fresh oil at 5pm. she said that multiple times that is was fresh. then she walked away. i just left it be. i didn\\'t want to get into it with her because my daughter was with me. poor customer service. will not be bothered with this place again. any other time it was fine. \\n\\n3 stars just because the food is good except for this time. also because of customer service., it\\'s was literally 3:01 and i am ordering a big order and my very last order was a lunch special.  the person taking my order said it\\'s too late for lunch special.  really?  if their online web order actually worked, i would have gotten my order through., too bad i cant rate a half a star.  cant believe this place is even open for business.  ordered thru grub hub, reviews were good.  got old jellied chicken with broccoli too nasty to eat and had to throw it out.  i even asked for extra hot sauce and duck sauce and got 2 of each for a $20 order.  atrocious food!  will never order from here again, stay away people, i use to order from here after but its been a while. i was craving chicken lettuce wraps. they use to have the best. i don\\'t know what they sent me but it was not that. it was gross. when i called i got attitude from the woman who answered the phone and was told the chicken was cut up. i know what ground chicken looks like. there was no chicken in my dish. it was greasy and not what i ordered. i have made this dish and eaten it many times i am aware what i look and taste like. gross!!!!, no bad. probably one of the better chinese restaurants in bensalem. ordered the general tso\\'s chicken which was all white meat. sadly over cooked or re heated too much. couldn\\'t eat it. i did call to let them know, employee  said that they do not re heat food ?? husband ordered the lo mein which was very good. really liked their wontons too. if the chicken was better  i would  have given a 4 or 5., too bad i cant rate a half a star.  cant believe this place is even open for business.  ordered thru grub hub, reviews were good.  got old jellied chicken with broccoli too nasty to eat and had to throw it out.  i even asked for extra hot sauce and duck sauce and got 2 of each for a $20 order.  atrocious food!  will never order from here again, stay away people., so the prices are unjustifiably high, no getting around it.  save yourself the pain of ordering a quiche because at that price i expect a sizable piece not a sliver.  the variety of crepes (especially the savory ones) is amazing and the quality is good but woof my poor wallet.  if you are craving authentic and tasty crepes this is the place to go but know you are going to be paying a hefty price., we peeked in and were  really hungry and thought crepes would be great right now. once seated i should have trusted my instincts and left. even my 8 year old complained about the dinginess of the place. it needs a complete rehab to capture the once cute rattan chairs now with stained cushions. the floor even with a severely good mopping would never be clean enough. our server yes flaky no real complaints, it was slow and my daughter noticed her chatting with the other server and then talking to the customers a different  voice. it was kind of funny, she should have her own yelp page. i felt like we were in the twilight zone, talking about our weird server while two girls in the next table chatted so loudly making it impossible not to ease drop.\\non to the food..the iced tea was painfully sweet, she said it was sweet but even diluted with water was just over bearing. and $3.50 . the caesar salad was just okay. the crepe was actually very good. but if i really want crepes again i will go to beau monde.\\n i had my wallet out before my daughter was finished just to get out of there quicker. we decided to pass up a desert crepe and head over to ben and jerry\\'s for a cone. see next review!, saw a $30 groupon and with my love for crepes, figured this place was worth a shot!\\n\\nwent there with my boyfriend and we waited to be seated. in waiting, we observed two servers and about 5-6 other tables seated with patrons.\\n\\nwe were seated after a few minutes and given menus. we then watched the two servers walk by several times and have a disagreement with a patron. \\n\\na table of two ladies sat patiently for several minutes and tried to paid cash but was told they did not have any change. they had to rush back to lunch after waiting to pay and then being told they did not have any change prompted their exit without paying the full tab.\\n\\nat this point, a few other tables had cleared out so they were not busy.. though it still took what felt like an eternity to get water and order.\\n\\n3 min: seated\\n13 min: asked for water\\n18 min: received water\\n28 min: asked to order\\n31 min: order taken\\n44 min: food served\\n\\ni parked at a meter and at this point, i wasn\\'t sure if we would even have time to chew our food!\\n\\nthe portions and quality didn\\'t warrant the price tag (fortunately we had a groupon). our crepes were very crispy and a bit burnt at the top. can i say, overpriced and disappointed?\\n\\ni won\\'t be returning but i do hope it was a one time incident.. for their sakes. they certainly didn\\'t leave a good impression on me or my boyfriend., french crepes, french service. took forever to get our food while the wait staff noisily bused and washed dishes next to our table. not worth the 2 hours or the headache., i went for an early dinner/late lunch before a shift at work. i walked in and it was completely empty. red flag maybe? i shrugged it off and was sat by the waiter. he was a nice gentleman. he pulled my chair out for me and poured a glass of water from a swing top bottle. it was a nice touch, the water had lemon slices and mint sprigs but when i took a sip, it wasn\\'t cold. \\n\\ni asked what his favorite crepes were and he directed me to one classic style and one that he described as oriental with sweet and sour sauce and couscous. yeah, i went with the classic, which had ham, mushrooms, spinach, and swiss cheese. once it was served, i could smell garlic, but after the first few bites, i couldn\\'t taste anything. no garlic, no seasoning, just a few bland bites of crepe and sliced deli ham. \\n\\ni finished the crepe which was pretty underwhelming but i had work later that evening and wanted something to fill my stomach. i couldn\\'t find any pieces of garlic but the smell was overpowering. there wasn\\'t any distinct flavor so i added a little bit of salt and ground pepper. yeah, that didn\\'t help either. \\n\\ni don\\'t think i\\'ll be coming back again. the server was nice but not very attentive. then again i was the only person in there in the 20 minutes i spent ordering, eating, and paying about $16 for a lackluster bite. \\n\\nspare yourself the cutesy wicker decor and make some crepes at home., went here last week after not eating here for over five years. hasn\\'t changed a bit.\\n\\nslow service (just like france), great crepes (just like france), unpretentious setting (just like france), french music playing (just like france) and most important, cutest french waiter (just like france)!!\\n\\nthis isnt a date place. its not a good place to serve a large group of people, not a good place for children and isnt the type of place if you have sooo many dietary restrictions. \\n\\ngo in, enjoy a fantastic crepe and leave. it\\'s that simple., as soon as i saw the yellow hipster kitten heels and cankles approaching us i should\\'ve run full speed anywhere else.  based on my love of crepes and fabulous experiences at every other creperie i\\'ve encountered i thought la creperie cafe live up to my basic crepe standards.  \\n\\ni am fully aware that no one will beat beau monde, but what i didn\\'t expect was the raw flour and pancake tasting oddly layered and barely filled mess that was placed in front of me. the food was awful, the service was worse and when i complained about the inedible food i heard a very loud and angry cook yelling about it. awesome. stay away, far, far away., overpriced blah food with poor service.  my $10 crepe tastes like something i can make at home and was tiny.  $4 for a lipton tea and a refill is another $4. service was unfriendly., although the crepes were good, they were not very filling. also, i was cheated out of more than $15 of my groupon. when i tried to order a dessert, i was informed that the kitchen had closed, even though i am sure i placed the order before the restaurant was closed. i will not be returning to this restaurant., the crepes are decent, but not good enough to make up for the surly staff, slow service, rickety furniture, and dirty glasses.  i\\'m not sure if takeout is an option at la creperie cafe, but that would be my choice if i had an uncontrollable hankering for a crepe while in the neighborhood.   \\n\\none star for fresh-squeezed orange juice plus one star for (begrudgingly) allowing substitutions., interested in having dinner in the middle of a heated domestic dispute?\\n\\nme and my fiance had dinner here last friday night, and it was a disaster.  for starters, their credit card machine was down (but he failed to mention that until he gave us the bill) and there was general pandemonium from a payment perspective.\\n\\nthis is obviously a minor issue.  but the story continues\\n\\nour dinner felt like we were in the middle of a domestic dispute.  the poor waiter guy was the only person on, and he was constantly in heated, loud yelling arguments with \"fatima\", the chef (and i presume his wife) upstairs in the kitchen.  at least the arguments were in french (how authentic!)\\n\\nanyhow, the table next to us ordered a crepe that normally included cheese.  the woman specifically said \"i\\'m allergic to cheese\" and requested it be left off.  \\n\\nwhen he delivered the crepe  the woman said \"i\\'m sorry, but this still has cheese in it.\"  he took the plate upstairs, where there was armageddon in the kitchen.  i took a little french in high school, and i could make out the following:\\n\\nserver:  fatima, i forgot to say she was allergic to cheese\\n\\nfatima:  i don\\'t care, they still have to pay for it\\n\\nand various iterations of that until the server came down, shame faced, and tried to give the cheese crepe back to the woman who would obviously have health issues if she ate it.  \\n\\nthey made her pay for a replacement crepe because they screwed up!! inexcusable\\n\\ni feel bad because the server was having an awful tme (and this kitchen dispute took, no joke, 10 minutes and everyone in the place was silent and uncomfortable for the next 30).  they ran out of cash to make change and it took him 30 minutes to catch up and clear tables after the throwdown with fatima.\\n\\nanyhow, to make a long story long, the \"dinner theater\" merely exacerbated  the slow service, lack of credit card machine, and ok food., when we came in, the waiter sit us but did not give menu. we had to wait like 8 minutes before he came back and we had to ask him for menu. \\nthe menu in general seemed good, but when we got an order, crepes were very greasy and not very tasty. tomatoes were old. \\nsweet one was better, but not great., armed with my $20 living social deal i tried la creperie cafe today. i walked in and to my surprise the place was pretty empty. the host/waiter brought me to my wobbly table for 1 and left me with the menu. if crepes are your thing, there are many to chose from. i went with feta et lardon and suzette, both poor choices. the bacon was dried , almost like beef jerky, not crispy or flavorful. the suzette was awful and tasted sour;  after 1 bite the fork went down and i asked for my bill. granted i am not sitting in a paris cafe but a street on sansom street; but i just thought this would be better. if i want crepes i will go to france., i ordered ahead on 04/6/12 & was already in center city. had to wait an eternity before my meal was brought from upstairs. the bill came to $25.92 & they were given $40.00. they had no change, so the guy in the back scrubbing the floor had to go & get change. i was given back $14.00 instead of $14.08. the waitress & the floor mopper had to scrounge up 8 cents between both of them & then copped an attitude as i waited for my change. will never go back., this place ultimately disappointed me, though there are certainly worse places to eat on sansom street.\\n\\nit took nearly 40 minutes for us to receive our food, despite the fact that the place was empty on a saturday night. this may have been due to the fact that, apparently, they have one employee. poor, poor man.\\n\\ni have to say, my crepe was pretty tasty. i got one with mushrooms and creme fraiche and it was lightly crisp around the edges, tender in the middle, perfectly salted.\\n\\nhowever, i simply can\\'t stomach the idea of paying $13 for a paper-thin pancake with some stuff smeared on it. unless that thing is gold-encrusted or has the secret to life inscribed upon it, that is a ridiculous price for a dinner that didn\\'t come close to filling my stomach., ventured in here because of a groupon deal.  we ordered sweet crepes and what arrived were crunchy crepes with sparse filling.  because the crepes were so crunchy, it was difficult to cut through them.  after attempting to saw through these things with the table wobbling like crazy, i ended up spilling half of my coffee.  the table also had nails sticking up out of it on my fiance\\'s side and she jabbed her elbow on them.  get some real tables!  service was okay, but the crepes aren\\'t very good, the table was wobbly and dangerous and it was too warm inside the cafe.  we won\\'t be going back., the crepes were very good. but boy was the service bad! it took about an hour to bring our food, the plates and napkins at our table were dirty, and the waiter spilled coffee on our table and didn\\'t clean it up., have been here twice - i really wanted to like this place! service was terrible - i think there is only 1 guy that works there - normally i am patient but he was extremely rude.\\n\\nmy strawberry and nutella crepe was burnt and had maybe 4 strawberries and a spoonful of nutella. could have made a better one at home.\\n\\nwill never go back, not much to say about this place.  the waitress, marilyn monroe was very nice. salad was tasty but there was an odd ingredient in the dressing.  crepe was very good flavor but chef didn\\'t know how to cook the crepe properly.  quiche was overcooked.  atmosphere was  cafeteria-like with flimsy tables and uncomfortable chairs.  sorry creperie, i won\\'t be returning.  \\nmy rec (though i didn\\'t yelp them) is beau monde in queen village., very iffy meal. four of six of us were happy, two were disappointed. the portions were small, the restaurant swelteringly hot and the service both slow and disorganized. not running back!, this place sucks.  the service is horrible.  if you are not too picky and don\\'t mind getting ignored and having to ask for even the dumbest of things (and wait all the while) then go.  the food is not bad but watch the mice droppings.\\n\\ni ate here earlier this month and wrote a conscientious letter to the owner.  not so much as \"boo\" in response.  ate here again last night (not my choice) and nothing has changed.  it was 45 minutes before the guy even acknowledged us.  had to ask for water; did not clear our plates.  no bread.  brought  the stuff out haphazardly.  just bad - and the poor guy was the only one working when they knew we had a party of 9 coming.  the \"cute\" girl must have bailed on him.\\n\\nstay away.  if the owner doesn\\'t care about the place, why should we?  let the place close.  \\n\\n\\nand here is what the health inspection revealed:\\ninspection date\\n2/27/07\\n7-01 (l) mouse infestation is present. mouse droppings observed on floors at bar counter, and on\\nfloors in kitchen.\\n9-04 (b) wiping cloths are used in an unapproved manner. wiping cloths are not stored in a sanitizing\\nsolution.\\n19-01.1 food establishment personnel food safety certified individual is not present., decided on crepes for lunch but was in for an unpleasant experience!\\n\\nordered fried plantains for appetizers. we must have waited for good 20 min until we decided to call the server to remind him about the appetizer and to take our lunch order out of fear that it might take them forever to prep that!! so the plantains came in with a side of \\'salsa\\'. that was a first..and we did not think plantains worked well with salsa at all...! anyway, we happily gobbled just the plantains as we waited for our crepe order. \\nthankfully the crepes came in time. i got myself the la royale crepe which had a filling of chicken, tomatoes, swiss cheese and basil. umm...just ok..nothing out of the world i would say.\\nwe asked him to split the bill between my friend and i but for some odd reason, he decided not to do that (minor issue but it reflected his indifferent attitude). anyway, since i did not think this was my best ever experience, i decided to tip this guy a 15% and we left.\\nto our surprise, he came running outside behind us saying \"excuse me, minimum tip is 18%, we don\\'t work for free\" in a very disgusted tone. this was very offensive in my opinion. it is my wish how much i decide to tip a server according to my experience at a restaurant. besides, the bill had pre-calculated tip values mentioned at 15, 20 and 25% which meant that 15% was appreciated. \\nbut our server didn\\'t think so! i doubt that i\\'m ever going back here..not even for the sweet crepes that might be good, my review is just based on this experience., i went to la creperie cafe twice, but only ate one meal. the first time we waited 30 minutes for our food, before canceling our order and just leaving because we had to made an appointment. the second time we went for sunday brunch. the service was a complete mess. both my friend and i had to change our orders because the kitchen was out of key brunch ingredients including smoked salmon and basil. a few minutes later the waiter returned to our table to ask what we had ordered (really? use a notepad). it probably took 10 min to get water, another 5 to get glasses, 20 minutes to get coffee, and 40 minutes to get actual food. the crepe was fairly good, but nothing to write home about. it\\'s definitely not worth it when you account for the incompetent service., holy yuck!!! i am so mad i just paid for that when the whole time i was force feeding myself i was praying i wasn\\'t going to get food posioning. thanks for the 15 dollar pile of burned rubbery eggs with skeptical \"salmon\" in it. my boyfriends \"crepe\" was also a just as much and came out looking like a pile of shit that they tried to cover up with an orange. water was hot and they were just refilling the bottle with fruit in it just to make it look fancy. bathroom was disgusting. decor was dirty and scary. we should of gone with our instinct and left. boooooo giving crepes a bad name!, the good: the food was tasty. i was served a crepe with turkey, goat cheese, apples, and almonds. i had never had a savory crepe with apples, and was pleased with the flavor.\\n\\nthe bad: i was served that crepe, but it wasn\\'t what i ordered. i didn\\'t want to send it back because the waiter, who seemed to only speak french, was running around like a chicken with his head cut off, even though there were only two other tables in the cafe. my cousin\\'s order was wrong too, but she also just ate what she was served. like i said, they were good, so we weren\\'t really complaining. but then we got the bill, and realized that the crepes we were served were each $3.50 more expensive than the ones we had ordered. \\n\\nso the service is my main complaint. the waiter didn\\'t write our orders down, walked away from the table before we had finished our order, brought the wrong food, didn\\'t check in with us after, brought our salad way after we had finished the crepes, never refilled our water glasses, but was real quick to bring and collect the bill when it was all over. so yeah, the food tasted good. but... i don\\'t think i would go back., i struggle with how to rate the food. the savory crepes i ordered were overcooked (crispy, black). based on these alone, i would rate them as poor. however, the sweet banana flambe crepe i ordered was to die for. so, i settle on \"good.\" the service was exactly what i would expect from a french cafe, rude. but there should be more consistency in the food., we went on a monday using our groupon and got the bum\\'s rush because they are not open for dinner on a monday.  the waiter was insolent and when my daughter\\'s order was incorrect said they kitchen was closed and he could not have it fixed.  i reminded him that he had moments earlier told us we would be able to get dessert so he said he would get the order fixed.  i\\'m sure they pawed through it and took out the offending peppers and then returned it.  i would not buy a groupon for here - and i would not recommend it.  don\\'t go., i lived in paris for 6 months, and ate a few more crepes than i should have...\\n\\nin any case, creperie cafe doesn\\'t really cut it. the crepes are a bit overpriced ($12 for a standard ham egg gruyere?), and they were small and greasy (weird). i would need two to fill up (granted i eat a lot) - but $24 for a couple crepes? no thank you.\\n\\nservers were nice, but seemed like the kitchen took way too long for a simple crepe at a completely empty place.\\n\\nwanted to love you cc, but you just weren\\'t very good., went to lunch there on advice from a friend, will rethink that friendship... the place did not smell good. service was sorta ok, although it was slow, and she didn\\'t re-fill water glasses, could not flag her down either. the place only had 2 other diners at the time, so no excuse. we ordered an appetizer to split, fried plantains in light tomato sauce, what arrived was fried plantains and a small container of packaged salsa, yuck...not at all what i had imagined.  my friend\\'s food arrived before mine...that may have been a good thing, we split both entrees, neither was very good., i called ahead to order a crepe and a quiche to go but the lady that answered the phone said they don\\'t do that. i asked if i went and ordered the food and wanted to take it with me could i do that, she obstinately responded they could not do that. my mom\\'s recovering from surgery with little to no appetite and she was craving a crepe so i was determined. i showed up with my own plastic to go recipients to put my food in and found a completely empty restaurant with a lone waiter. i sat at the bar and explained what i wanted and he explained i needed to sit at a table because \"she does not like people sitting at the bar\". interesting since there are at least 6 bar chairs.... mmmkay.  i ordered my crepe and quiche and he returned to inform me it might take a whole because they \"needed to turn the stove back on\".  whut???  i know this wasnt the middle of the lunch craze (if they have one), it was 2:30pm but i wouldn\\'t guess turning a stove on would be so tedious. i asked if they close during the day but he said they\\'re open until 10pm. je ne comprend pas!, oh my god, the worst la creperie place in america i don\\'t know how they can call themselves a french crepe place. this is an insult to the french people. \\n\\nminutes after leaving and i\\'m already on the verge of throwing up the the ultra mini ice cream & disgusting crepe for $$13 that comes with a side of the worst service just top of everything, this place was ok...but only ok. the crepes were so underfilled....i honestly think i got one tiny piece of olive in my vegetarian crepe. the best one was the nutella and strawberry crepe....and it\\'s pretty hard to screw that up. as other reviewers said, there was no a/c. the service was ok...the waiter wasn\\'t overly friendly nor did he refill our water glasses more than once, but he wasn\\'t mean and our crepes came out pretty quickly. wouldn\\'t go back..., i bought a groupon for this place and we went for dinner. there was only one waiter there and he kept forgetting to bring things to our table (e.g., brought over soda with no glasses two times, took forever to bring check). the crepes weren\\'t that good b/c they didn\\'t have much in them at all! we ended up getting out dessert crepes at beau monde instead of staying here for dessert, i appreciate that they offer gluten free crepes, but in general i was disappointed with the prices.  dear god, some of the crepes are $14, $15, even $16!!!  i would never spend that kind of money on one crepe, that\\'s highway robbery!  also a cup of soup was $9., i really wanted to like this place. the atmosphere itself was nice and very french. service sucks though. i came into an empty café and the waitress told me i had to wait to be seated. we were the only two in the room. she had an attitude, too :/ anyway, the menu was amazing, so many to choose from! props for originality. but so not worth the price at all. i paid almost $20 on two tiny, crispy (crêpes aren\\'t supposed to be crispy!), dry, flavorless crêpes. needless to say, i was super disappointed. i left, sad and still hungry., their slogan is \"the finest crepes in town!\" - and i might have believed that about the location in phoenixville - but the la creperie cafe in philly left me underwhelmed.  it seemed they rested their laurels on a waiter knowing how to pronounce thing in french.\\n\\ni had something with ground beef, some sort of cheese, onions and herbs.  it was a bit on the dry side and the crepe seemed overall uninspired - a problem as the waiter described the section of the menu i ordered from was supposed to be the owner\\'s specialties.  ingredients weren\\'t what i normally think of from a philly creperie.  the meal was way overpriced, the portion smaller than most crepe places i\\'ve been and the restaurant lost and extra star for serving me my coke in a can.\\n\\nwatch your bill.  we had a change to a crepe - from goat cheese to swiss - and they tried charging $3.50 for the cheaper cheese.  tea was 5 bucks, cokes were expensive too.\\n\\ni\\'m voting pass., sloooooowww service. they should have more than 2 (cook and waiter) employees working during brunch on sunday., la creperie is a cute space that is a lot bigger than it looks from the outside.  the service was slow (one waitress?), the decor was closer to little havana than france, and the food was so-so.  \\n\\nmy friend and i ordered a salad to start with warm goat cheese and sundried tomatoes to start.  the dressing was a honey mustard something or other, which just didn\\'t go well.  the goat cheese was really gritty, to the point where i said it reminded me of eating sand.  the menu is huge, but pricey, and i have to disagree with other yelpers who say this place is authentic.  they have a philly cheesesteak crepe on the menu-  that is about as far from authentic as you can get.  nevertheless, i had a seafood crepe with shrimp, tomato and mushroom in a white wine sauce.  it was more like a tomato sauce and mushroom filled crepe with four shrimp on top.  the flavor was decent, but it wasn\\'t what i was expecting from the menu description.  my friend created her own crepe, but was less than thrilled.\\n\\nit wasn\\'t a complete waste of time, but i won\\'t be back anytime soon., went here for breakfast one day and had a less than ideal experience. there was not a soul in the place on a saturday morning... this should have tipped me off. bf and i ordered our crepes... mine was the completely wrong order. his had a huge clump of hair in it. not a strand, a clump. we brought this to the waitress\\' attention and she was very polite and obviously embarrassed. she quickly comped our meal and we were on our way. on a positive note- our lattes were to die for- yummm! \\n\\ni was disappointed with the whole experience. but will say that since we didn\\'t eat much, i can\\'t give an honest opinion about the food. but given the big hair clump, i won\\'t ever return to find out. our waitress was gracious, apologetic and prompt - so the service in that aspect was perfectly fine., the portion is small and the taste is average, i do not think its worth your $15 for their crepe, there are much better options for crepe else where.\\n\\nthey charged me additional $10 tip for a $28 meal when i left $5 cash, $5 is 17% tip, but $10 is 35% tip! way to tip for average service!\\nthe additional tip was charged without my authorization on my credit card... way to surprise me... i\\'m never going back there.\\nplease save your self some $ and take your business else where for sub-par crepe and scammy waiter., from first walking in through the door to leaving, la creperie cafe was unpleasant. the air conditioner was not functioning and it was so humid inside.. luckily we were seated closer to the door. the tables were filthy and old. there were old crumbs, food scraps and dust stuck in the crevices of the table where we were seated. we had to wipe our utensils again because they were not clean at all. we went with our groupon and i suppose most of their customers come with groupon deals, because that was the first thing they asked us when we were seated. we ordered quiche and two crepes with two iced teas ($3.50 each!!). i was able to notice right away that the quiche was old and just  reheated. the crepes were mediocre and felt it was overpriced for the amount that i got. i would suggest the creperie truck on the temple university campus on 13th and norris street for much better crepes and more reasonable prices. overall, the food was overpriced and the service was not good at all. i would never step foot into this place again., yes i did go back there with a friend who wanted to eat dessert crepes! and yes, i can\\'t deny that the crepe was really good, but again...slow slow service., very good salad app (and huge, we split it), ok-entree, great iced tea, sloooooowoow service. the place is cute & has the potential to be the great place you think it will be when you walk in. however the only waitress paid extra attention to the only other party in the restaurant, a large party of maybe 7 or 8, instead of us (party of 2). she was very sweet when she did come by the table & refilled our tea many times but the food was so so freakin slow i probably could have gone home & made it myself & brought  it back before we got our entrees.  i know you cant blame the waitress for the kitchen staff but come on, speak up for your only patrons! the large party previously referred to was so rude/ loud & when we finally got our food, they decided it was time to sing along to the whole entire \"put a ring on it\" beyonce song which was blasting from their cell... the waitress said nothing but hummed along, probably thinking she was getting a big tip & not caring one bit if i liked second hand beyonce with my french crepes. finally they got their bill & started complaining because apparently something was bad but they hadn\\'t told the waitress until just then, which she tried to explain is the incorrect way to report a discrepancy and which only made things worse for us since we couldn\\'t pay/leave until they figured out their issues. to make matters worse, i was pretty ill very soon after we left & i cant help but make the connection to other reviews here that i had bad food. (ps my husband\\'s entree was good & he didnt get sick).  i wont be going back. \\nreally, so sad b/c this place has a great potential & the food on the menu all sounds so good, and it\\'s a byob., i love the crepes at this place! the batter is delicious and tasty, the fillings generous. that\\'s why i was willing to brave the terrible service  several times hoping it was a fluke. you could sitting at one of two occupied tables in the restaurant (and i know this because my friend and i were sitting at one of them) and you will be ignored, have to seat yourself, not be offered water until you ask, wait ten minutes for your water to arrive, have to ask for the menus because they\\'ve never been given to you, wait ten minutes for the menu, wait forever for your order, and then, once finished eating, wait an eternity for your check to be taken and processed.\\nput more simply, it\\'s the worst service i\\'ve had in the city, so after ten visits, i unfortunately had to conclude the aggravation outweighs the delicious joy that is both their dessert and savory crepes., i came across this place with a friend while looking for a quick place to eat around rittenhouse last weekend. after having a phenomenal crepe in new orleans a few weeks ago, i was super excited to have another one as i had been craving them! we were seated instantly.. the place was pretty dead. the service was great and extremely attentive. the issue is the food and pricing. i wanted a savory crepe and decided to go with the \"la norvegienne\" which was smoked salmon, brie, zucchini, and basil. sounded amazing and i was really looking forward to it. my friend ordered one of the chicken savory crepes. \\n\\nour food came out quickly. the first thing i noticed was that my crepe was about half the size of my friends! i instantly was disappointed. not only was my crepe pretty small, but it wasn\\'t even very good. the smoked salmon was not what i am used to and it was more of a fishy and unseasoned flavor.. not the salty, smooth taste that i was expecting. the rest of the crepe was just not that great and fell flat. i finished it in about 5 minutes because of the sheer lack of food! my friend wasn\\'t very impresed with hers either, though at least hers was more filling. for my crepe, water, tax, and tip, i paid 18 bucks.. and i was starving when i left. do yourself a favor and spend your money elsewhere!, today (march 11, 2016) i noticed a sign saying they have moved. this location is shut down., expensive, bad food and service.\\ni have been to other corner bakery cafes, and i usually like them, but i tend to get terrible service at this one. these problems manifests as long waits for meals even during slow times, and getting orders wrong.\\nthe last time (never again) i went in it was a slow morning, and it took them 45 minutes to get me my eggs, and when they came they were cold. i informed the cashier that my eggs were cold and i asked him if they could make me new eggs.  he said yes, and took my eggs.  he came back out with my same plate, and it was evident that he microwaved the plate with the toast and fruit on it; the toast was soggy, and fruit warm. i returned my food, and have vowed to never return., today i went into this location around 5 pm and it was completely empty. the young girls that were working did not greet me and the girl who took my order was so snotty that i left without completing the order. this was my first time here and i had a horrible experience. i will not return., maybe it\\'s the day but they are literally out on the majority of the menu as well as utensils and lids....., how do you run out of potatoes at a breakfast restaurant on a sunday morning? this the 3rd time this has happened to me at this particular location? it\\'s not like there is a potatoe shortage? make more potatoes. i am able to write this review because this is taking forever. time to find a new breakfast restaurant, just ok, but wouldn\\'t go back. i usually never come here, but came here the other day for a quick lunch. \\n\\ni ordered a large wonton salad for $8.99. my husband got a turkey panini for $7.99. the turkey panini wasn\\'t worth it at all. hell, i make better sandwiches at home! a few slices of turkey, some cheese, a tomato and that was about it. you get a bag of chips with it and a pickle that looks like it\\'s been sitting in their fridge forever. \\n\\nfor only $1 more i had a large bowl with a tasty salad. i was actually pretty happy with it and felt i had a healthy lunch. there was plenty of chicken in it. \\n\\nthe girl at the counter wasn\\'t particularly friendly. she looked bored and spoke very softly, so i wasn\\'t sure what she saying half the time. the cafe was extremely cold when i came here. \\n\\nfor the price we paid and for what we got, i\\'d rather go to a diner. my husband could\\'ve even got a better sandwich at wawa., we went there on a weekend morning with a corner bakery coupon for pancakes.\\n\\nthe cashier said, \"we don\\'t make pancakes at this location.\"\\n\\n*blank stare*, meh, i\\'ve had better.  after trying out breakfast and lunch here i\\'ve come to the conclusion that in spite of a cute interior and what sounds like a pretty decent menu the food here is mediocre.   the food is bland and practically tasteless.  coffee is just ok but each time i\\'ve gotten an iced latte they never fill up my cup leaving about 2 inches of space.  not to mention their medium is the same size as a nordstrom e-bar small.  for about the same price.  my breakfast sandwich was perhaps the most disappointing of all.  lack of flavor plus whimsy bread equals a boring sandwich that is falling apart.  such a bummer!, i love the food at corner bakery however the restaurant in king of prussia is extremely dirty.  i went last week and the floors were filthy, it smelled of dirty rug as soon as you walked.  i was so disappointed because i like the food but....yuk can\\'t eat here anymore., food is pretty good here, but the service is not so good.  the staff seemed a little surly.  when you asked them questions, they made an annoyed face before sighing and giving me an answer, had they rolled their eyes, i would have been out the door.  i normally don\\'t go to this location, i just happened to be near the king of prussia mall that day.  i most likely will not return here, i\\'ll stick with the ardmore location where they actually want my business., we got takeout for our office and i found it very disappointing.  i wanted something light and small and got the avocado and spinach power flat.  there was barely avocado in it and what was there was brown and not particularly tasty. a leaf or 2 of spinach was all.  perhaps because it had it picked up and brought to our office so it sat a little but the bread was a big soggy mess and basically inedible. \\ni got a side salad of a caesar salad and it was no better than buying a bag of chopped lettuce at the store and a bottled dressing. very small and disappointing. \\nthe other items which people got didn\\'t look particularly spectacular. i wouldn\\'t go out of my way to go here., the place was pretty busy so i was excited. the menu looked great and as a vegetarian i had lots of choices. i ordered a flatbed sandwich with avocado and asked for egg whites. the cashier struggled with the order but finally got it.\\n\\nthe bad part was that it took a long time for everything. my espresso shot was cold and bitter. the sandwich tasted pretty good but was also cold and much smaller than what was pictures on the menu. lastly i never got the side of fruit i ordered. my wife had a parfait and said it was just ok., this place is horrible . i was here for a breakfast meeting . the eggs were horrible, the soft drinks were flat and the fruit in the fruit cup was rotten . i put a picture of the fruit cup below. hopefully you can appreciate the cream cheese film over the black fruit in my fruit cup. \\nplease don\\'t eat here!, far from amazing experience. started when we walked into the door and i was told to \"wait\" in a rude tone. we weren\\'t even ready to order- 5 minutes later (i wish i was exaggerating) another woman came to take our order. it was a simple order 3 sandwich and kids mac & cheese. it took 20 minutes for our to go order to be made. those who ordered after us got their food- when we got our food the mac & cheese and panini were cold. i have gone 2 x since they have opened & service and food was poor. today it was obvious it was an inconvenience for customers to be there, waiting in line 2 deep for more than 5-7 minutes while employees in aprons looked at us and worked around the two of us standing at the register.  on occasion the employees looked at us but clearly were not in charge of the register.  eventually i left.  cheers to the person who stayed and waited - must really be good baked goods - i will not know., my husband and i stopped by on the way to work. we order the anheim breakfast and the cheese and bacon panini. not only did my breakfast did not look like the picture, it was missing some of the ingredients like avocado and missing the toast. and the breakfast was $9. the taste was not that great either. my husband\\'s sandwich was ok, just ok for $8. as for the lattes, they do not do almond milk. my latte was about/less than half  in the cup. for the $4 for a medium latte, i wish it would have brought at least 3/4 of the latte in the cup. and who doesn\\'t do almond milk these days?\\ndissapointment..., wasn\\'t what i expected from the positive reviews.  the woman working the front register was not customer friendly or helpful.  it was like we were bothering her.  she was rude and not someone to have to initially greet customers.  this place is total mask enforcement and rude about it. they literally will yell at you.  it was quite ridiculous and embarrassing. they are so worried about covid, but cleanliness was sub-par. the food, mediocre at best. would have had a better experience at a panera or other place for sure.  with all the businesses closing because of covid, this place needs to appreciate the people who walk through the front doors and worry more about customer service, quality and cleanliness, instead of chasing people down for accidentally getting up from a table without a mask., placed an order at 6:18pm. they took the ordered at 6:19pm.  delivery said 7:05pm.  7:30 i cantacted grubhub because the restaurant refused to answer the the phone.   the restaurant said 10 more mins.   8:30pm i contacted grubhub again the restaurant said 20 more mins.  at this point i cancelled the order and since it\\'s curfew at 8pm today.  i ended up with ramen noodles.   i will order indian food at my regular place tomorrow. i shouldn\\'t have given a new place a try.  so disappointed, not sure what has changed here but the food is not as good as it used to be, also the delivery service used to be great and on time but has slowed down recently. the food is either overly spiced or too sweet. the chicken tikka masala is overly sweet and the pakoras were oily and stale.  need to find a new indian spot with better food and dependable delivery., we were super excited to find out there was an indian restaurant close to our apartment within walking distance, as me and my boyfriend love indian food. unfortunately we were disappointed with a below average meal. naan and veggie platter were average. paneer tikka masala was below average - very oily on top and not creamy. we originally were going to go with hot level of spicy, but we were advised that it was very hot. so we went with medium level spiciness for both dishes. we should have gotten hot because there was barely any kick to it at all. saag was also just average. probably would not go here again., open when says it\\'s closed, closed when it says it\\'s open. terrible customer service, food is good but a pain just to get a hold. they need someone who knows how to use the internet, ordered the chicken tikka masala. because of other reviews i ordered it extra spicy. still not spicy at all. the naan was soft and chewy. and they replaced the meat the samosas with veggie without contacting me, as requested. flavor wasn\\'t terrible but with so many other great indian places around, i won\\'t be ordering from here again., i ordered a lot of food including samosa, when i took the first bite in samosa it smelled bad like stale. i was really stale and slimy. i called the restaurant and they said they will give me refund, however it\\'s not acceptable to give stale and spoiled food. i will never ever order from this place, update at bottom - got food poisoning for sure from the chicken korma. \\n\\noriginal review: man, what happened kurry shack? you were my go to! right around the corner, always decent sized portions, food was hot, spicey and delivered with quickness.\\n\\ni ordered one of my usuals tonight - chicken korma, and basically got no chicken and a funky tasting curry. has some extra tang to it in a bad way, something is off. and on top of that, literally the least amount of chicken i\\'ve ever gotten from them. 4.83 ounces, absolutely pitiful compared to other neighborhood indian places, even compared to kurry shack 3 or 4 months ago this is just sad. \\n\\ni weigh and measure everything i eat for dietary reasons and kurry shack used to clock in with 6.5 to 8 ounces of chicken in the various curry dishes (tikka, korma, etc). i have an order from july clocking in at 7.7 ounces, and june at 6.5 ounces, among others in a similar range. \\n\\nthis is barely 40 grams of protein. really a damn shame as kurry shack used to have just phenomenal flavor and portions.\\n\\nupdate: got extremely sick after eating this and leaving the review last night. woke up this morning and i\\'m still sick. will spare yelp the gruesome details but the aftermath of this rotten curry is not pretty. would avoid at all costs. bumping the review down to 1 star for banishing me to the toilet for two days., west philly seems to have the only indian food that we truly enjoy. kurry shack is so close that we hoped it would satisfy our cravings, but it just didn\\'t. the samosas weren\\'t as delicious, the tika masala was meh. the chicken vindaloo was better and you really have to try hard to need up naan. the best part of the meal for me was the rice, which has great flavor. the alu palak was okay, and the spice level of medium was great. we won\\'t be back though., completely wrong order which is normally not that bad if the restaurant is willing to correct their mistake and send you a new order. however they decided to blame the driver and the driver decided to blame the restaurant so we are shit out luck eating 1/3 of a meal that we spent over $100 on. terrible service., i wish i didn\\'t even have to give it 1 star which is so sad because i have always loved this place the few times i\\'ve been. \\n\\nme and my 2 daughters walked here because we wanted their food so bad.. but.. the customer service i just received was literally.. by far.. the worst customer service i\\'ve ever experienced in my 34 years. \\n\\nno one was at the counter when we came in.. i finally notice a self serve area to electronically place order but i had a question. after waiting 15 minutes thinking someone would eventually come from the back to great us.. i became frustrated with waiting and called \"hello\" (not rudely) to the kitchen thinking maybe they just didn\\'t realize we had been waiting. still ignored for about 5 minutes a man that was in the kitchen cooking came to the front and literally started yelling at me \"do you not see we are busy\" \"no one is up front\" \"we are in the back busy\" \\nso i reply.. \"of course i can\\'t see what is going on in the back and we\\'ve been here for 20 min waiting with no one to help and i have a question\" \\nhe again yells at me \"we are busy\" \\nso i ask \"who am i suppose to ask my question to so i can finish my order\" \\n\\nhe literally ignored my question and walked away. still not helping me!! \\nnever.. and i mean never.. will this place ever receive my money again. horrible, horrible customer service and if that\\'s the way they treat people that pay to keep their business open then i hope their business sinks!, went here last night for the first time.  service was crazy slow, and to quote-up zanna \"it took a year and a day to get\" our food.  i guess we were supposed to \"understand\" that our server was also the bartender and we were suppose to \"know\" that because of this service was going to be devastating slow.  but seriously, are you serious?  \\n\\nanyways, the server finally came over and she was like, frazzled and all and asked for us to give our order.  we said \\'em, she didn\\'t write \\'em down, 20 (!!!) minutes later another server came to ask what we had ordered just to \"go over our order again.\"  is my review just like zanna\\'s?  sorry.   \\n\\nanyways, food finally came out.  i was famished.  i was stoked to see that fish and chips was a very nice plate of fish and chips.  the fish was a massive fillet that was nice and crisp but not too flavorful (yay for malt vinegar) and the chips were very well seasoned.  great for $11.  the bf got gazpacho and it was nice and flavorful as well.  i don\\'t like gazpach that much, but his was yummy.  i don\\'t like cold soups.  ew. \\n\\nanyways, i might be back to explore the other floors.  service was horrible.  we left her a \"you\\'ve been yelped\" card., despite a recent renovation, the black sheep is dingy and dirty and the sloppiest, most unattractive hostess (that is until i saw our waitress) sat us at our table upstairs. although it was 10 pm on a wednesday night, she was hesitant about sitting a party of two at a large table. perhaps she was expecting a sudden stream of late night diners. the waitress was as sloppy and disheveled as the hostess. no makeup, no hairstyle and clothes that looked as though she found them on the street. i ordered something from the menu that did not have goat cheese listed as one of its ingredients, but she argued with me that the menu did have it listed. i showed her the menu and corrected her. she was rude and had a nasty attitude. i guess i would too if i looked like her. it was $30 for a burger, a salad and two diet cokes.the staff is arrogant, the place is filthy and the food is perfect for those who don\\'t care about their health or appearance and like to stuff their faces with a bunch of high fat, high cholesterol, high calorie greasy food. no thanks., i\\'d give the black sheep another try. but next time, i\\'d do it in a group of less than 25 people. we came on a thursday night, expecting to immediately take over the downstairs section at around 5:30pm. but come to find out, it did not open up until at least 7pm, even later depending on when the bartender got in and got set up.\\n\\nour server was as kind as she could be with a whole mess of rowdy professionals on their third beer, wanting to escape her section for the freedom and convenience of the downstairs bar.\\n\\naside from the crowded conditions, and the sometimes surly service, the black sheep has plenty to offer from great beers on tap to pub food abounding to entrees straight out of ireland. i\\'d been here for dinner before and had a relatively good experience then, so i\\'m not denying that you can have a great night at the black sheep. just don\\'t show up with 25 of your closest friends at happy hour and expect to find seats. it ain\\'t happening., a group of yelpers and i were all appalled at the level of service we received at this establishment. from the start this hovel of mediocrity fell on its face by not seating us at all; the hostess was not even at the door. we seated ourselves. once we were in, the bar-tending waitress, who seemed to be running the show upstairs, took our drink orders, all the while giving off the aura of disdain and employment-regret that could sear hair off.\\n\\nwe had to wait around for over 30 min for someone to take our actual orders and after i took it upon myself to express to the waitress that were getting antsy. the forceful ok and stare i got back did tick me off but i decided i wouldn\\'t make a huge deal of it. i gave her a well-timed \"alright, [pause] thank you\" until she broke eye contact and went back to our table. not a pleasant experience. even after all of this, someone was sent to \"confirm\" our orders 10 min later.\\n\\nwhen we finally received the food it didn\\'t impress me terribly. the fish and chips plate was plentiful but the fish itself was somewhat greasy and bland. however, the humus platter was huge and pretty darn tasty (but nothing that can\\'t be found elsewhere). decent prices though.\\n\\nthe dcor of this place was as mediocre as was everything else about it. wooden booths and low lighting define this place, as well as ever other pub everywhere else; the only distinction being the occasional framed picture of a sheep.\\n\\n(i must admit i did not get to see much of the lower floor and dined upstairs)\\n\\nthe upstairs had large windows that may open to take in some night air - but they were closed when we were there. \\nmy advice, if you\\'re in the neighborhood go to monk\\'s just around the corner. price point may differ but hell, so does quality!, i lived around the corner from black sheep for two+ years, and i wanted to like it.  everytime i went, i wanted to like it.  but everytime i left...yeah, not so much.  part of the problem is the plethora of better bars nearby, most notably good dog, monk\\'s, tangier, and, of course, mcglinchey\\'s.  another issue: hostess seating in the main room at all times - why?  it\\'s a bar, just let people come in, get a beer, and sit where they find a seat.\\n\\nbut the bigger problem is the clientele.  not exactly a neighborhood (or city) crowd.  for whatever reason this place draws an \"older\" crowd, and not in a good way.  and when the crowd is younger, it seems as though all of them crossed the ben franklin bridge to get there.\\n\\nfood: american cheese in the quesadilla is never, never ok. let that be your indication.\\n\\nlong story short: there\\'s better bars., i took a bunch of yelp people here after an elite happy hour because i kind of like this place.  we had horrible service, from the hostess not being at the door so we had to fend for ourselves, to having horrible slow service upstairs, to the fucking disgustingly weak mixed drinks.   it\\'s a shame because my previous experiences with this place have been ok and i like the food.  i will probably not go back unless desperate with fado being only a couple of blocks away., we went there sunday for lunch.  i would have thought an hour would have been enough time for lunch, but 40min later - still no food.  i ordered the fish n chips, and my wife ordered a bacon cheeseburger.  her burger was pretty much a hockey puck,  my fish on the other hand was on the \"rare\" side.  safe to eat, but could have been better done.  the crust on the fish struck my like the oil could have been changed sooner.  on the up side the waitress was cheery - albeit not quite on top of things, the venue was very pleasant.  i wanted to really like the place but meh., normally i would say that black sheep is a fine, low key bar with a good beer list and chill atmosphere.  like others have said, it houses the spill over from monks, which isn\\'t a bad thing.\\n\\nhowever, after a recent visit, and also in face of the increasing number of gastropubs and good beer bars across the city, i\\'d have to say pass on this one (unless waiting for monks).  the apps were sub-par, the guacamole was just gross and when one bathroom was out order, the alternative had a flooded floor complete with no toilet paper and a dead cockroach., perhaps i caught this place on an off night, but the service was abysmal and the food was mediocre at best. the really off putting aspect of the experience was being ignored by the server and having to go to the bar for drinks only to be ignored again. lastly, the tap was down, so there were no drafts. time for some quality control., i almost came here for quizzo a bunch of times, but i\\'m perpetually late.  it was so crowded by the time i got there--i decided to bail.\\n\\ni was here this past week for dinner by recommendation from a friend, whom urged me to try their great burger.  \\n\\nthe waitress was awesome.  she seemed to be happy working there, so good.  \\n\\nwe ordered the tomato soup first.  it was an awesome purée, but they should probably mention by word of mouth or on the menu that it is purely half jalapeño purée.  we even inquired about it.  mouth on fire, and far too much heat for a simple soup(in my opinion).  it could have been amazing, having a nice consistency. \\n\\nthe bangers and mash looked like a plate of sludge.  couldn\\'t look at it.\\ni ordered the burger medium rare; nothing fancy.  came out gray, rock solid, and greasy.  the meat tasted bad, too.  really, poor quality.  i asked the waitress for a new one medium rare...at this point i\\'m starving. \\nshe politely apologized and took it away.  \\nabout a minute later a rude guy with curly,mid length,dirty blonde hair basically tosses some uncooked meat onto the table with a snarl.  this was clearly in edible, and i was afraid he did something to it, for real.  i had to tell the waitress again it was now uncooked... not just undercooked.  she was extremely apologetic, again.  she offered anything on the menu on the house.  i politely declined.  that guy came out again to give me another dirty look....weirdo.\\nnever again.  \\n\\nfive stars to our sweet waitress, thank you., this place is a block away from my apartment, so i\\'ve been there a handful of times, and everything is always mediocre. \\n\\nit\\'s a small cozy bar that has a number of draft beers and a decent food menu. do not get their sweet potato fries! my excitement dwindled fairly quickly when i realized they were so fried up, it was like eating stringy crackers. i prefer sweet potato fries to be plump.\\n\\ntheir calamari is not fresh, salad oversized but nothing special, and chicken tenders flavorless. \\n\\nif you are looking for good food and drinks, look elsewhere., was here for a private event and experienced atrocious service, bad enough that i would not go back.\\n\\ntheir website touts their ability to handle large groups for private events... but they were completely unprepared to handle the group. service was extremely slow, and our server was rude as well. from ordering to receiving food took at least 40 minutes. when one person\\'s food came out (missing an item), we asked the server when we could expect the other food and received a rude and unhelpful response of \"it\\'s a small kitchen.\" no refills were offered on coffee. one food order came out a good 15 minutes before the others. getting the attention of the server was nearly impossible.\\n\\nthe food itself was adequate--nothing special, but nothing wrong with it. the \"maple syrup\" described in the menu was pancake syrup rather than actual maple syrup (which is fine... just don\\'t call it maple syrup if it\\'s not!).\\n\\nwe were also charged for an item we didn\\'t order and it was an ordeal to get the attention of the server to get it removed from the bill, and no apology was offered when we pointed out the mistake.\\n\\noverall, very unimpressed. they clearly weren\\'t prepared to handle the group and seemed to fell no need to apologize for their lack of preparation., good for drinks late at night and that\\'s about it. wait service is fucking terrible. i didn\\'t know that it took some one 30 minute to bring water over. also i didn\\'t know why the appetizer came 15 minutes after our meals. the waitress, was awful. she knew surprisingly nothing about the drink menu, and even surprisingly less about the food menu. when we asked how many pieces of chicken came with the chicken tender basket she said... \\n\"it comes with chicken\"\\ni said \" yes but how many pieces\"\\nshe said \"a lot\"\\n\"so that means about 4 or 5\"\\n\"maybe\"\\n\\nummm what? i wonder if she even worked there sometimes. the food was sub par... they use cheese wiz on their nachos, and too much cheese wiz as that. i had to get up and find my own bottle of ketchup for my friends soggy fries. and i was surprised that after asking what the house dressing was that would come on my side salad and being told that it was a vinaigrette... when in all actuality it was caesar. \\n\\npaying the bill was interesting because we gave her a credit card and she asked if we needed change... and the credit card wasn\\'t in a check book so that probably lets you know how smart she really is. and it took her about 20 minutes to bring the bard back to us and she waited over our shoulders to see how much tip we were leaving. now that\\'s classy.\\n\\n\\nthe only upside is the massive amounts of bathrooms. and the calamari is pretty good. that\\'s about it. maybe they should take their wait staff to burger king and show them what mediocre service is like because that would be a step up for them, beer and ambiance, fine. food, no bueno.  thinking the tuna guacamole would be like jose/sancho pistola\\'s, i was horrified to find out that black sheep\\'s version was basically canned tuna, mayo, and a little bit of avocado. filet mignon sliders were hard to chew. the fries that came with it were strangely dense. the wings had a decent flavor but were not crispy enough. i learned my lesson., to all party planners, i don\\'t recommend booking an event at black sheep pub.  after booking the second floor 5 weeks ahead of my event, the bar double-booked the space.  i learned this information 2 weeks before the date of my party, which was too late for me to find another venue for 30 people. they pushed my party downstairs into the cramped space in front of the fireplace until the other event finished.  we were told we would be in this small space for about an hour and then would be allowed upstairs to the second floor.  one hour turned to two hours.  we were finally permitted upstairs two hours after my original booking.  i was told the party before mine was spending more money and planned parties there regularly.  to reduce party planning stress, don\\'t book your party at black sheep pub. if you do decide to book a party at this establishment, i suggest checking your reservation frequently in case you also get double-booked.   \\n\\nthe bar did not apologize verbally for their lack of respect to my reservation.  no food or drink discount was offered for the inconvenience.  the bar sent over a free drink for me, which in my opinion was not enough of an apology for the number of people i brought to their bar.  i will not be booking another event at black sheep pub., i came here last weekend for birthday drinks with a friend. even with the snowpocalypse among us, the place was absolutely packed. clearly this is a happening spot. we ended up going to the downstairs bar which has a cool vibe and seems like a nice place to have drinks with friends. unfortunately, the vibe was  thrown off by the overflowing toilets directly adjacent to where we were standing at the bar. was it off-putting? yes-but even more off-putting was the staff member attending to the mess. as people passed by the doomed toilets (regardless of if they were trying to get to the bathroom or not) he would loudly complain (essentially shouting across the room) that the bathroom was out of order because people don\\'t know how to use toilets/use too much toilet paper.  dude, i understand your frustration, but yelling at random patrons of your bar isn\\'t going to fix your toilet. aside from the toilet issues it seems like a cool place, but at the moment i\\'m in no hurry to return to black sheep pub., ok, so i hate giving the black sheep one star but i have to. their beer selection is really sub par but its bearable. the main reason the place got one star is the food. now i know this is really just a cool pub in a posh neighborhood but are they trying to be a gastro pub? i don\\'t know... the fish tacos we got were literally atrocious. they were just salty, extremely greasy (not in a good hangover food greasy but just downright putrid) along with being soggy and sad. there staff there are very nice or at least pleasant otherwise this place would be a total epic fail. there wasn\\'t any fish in our fish tacos which i found terribly either cheap or just a slap in the face sine they are fish tacos! i couldn\\'t identify the fish which was strange since i eat and cook more fish than anyone i know. there was no sauce to accompany this mysterious sea creature tucked away in this very soggy clearly store bought tortillas. now maybe i am a little biased because i lived in l.a. for a few years and they have some of the best fish tacos on earth next to ones that i have made courtesy of all recipes. to sum it up they were lacking in every way shape and form even down to the pathetic over salted sides. i was told by the bartender that i should go with the shepards pie and i wish i would have listened. why would i get fish tacos at a place like black sheep when its clearly an irish pub? call it being adventurous and being very hopeful that this great pub would deliver the \"goods.\" anyway don\\'t go fish tacos unless you\\'re completely loco! sorry sheep.... still love ya., really wish j could give no stars... this place was horrible -- from the time we walked in until we left! we just moved to the rittenhouse neighborhood and were told to try here... went on a saturday night to get a few drinks... all staff was rude and could care less about us being there... took forever to get a drink and when we finally did it was watered down... this truly lives up to its namesake - do not go here they are by far the worse bar we\\'ve been to in philly! what a disgrace!, great bar....but never have a party here.  they don\\'t keep your reservation.  they will take your money to reserve the room downstairs, but will not actually hold that reservation.  and when you have 30 of your guests, supposed to head down to your reserved room while its full of strangers, they\\'ll be total jerks about it.  never going back., the kitchen needs an update... my chicken sandwich was bland and the roll was stale.  i couldn\\'t finish it..\\n\\nthe service and decor is nice... but the food is not up to par with typical irish pub fare in the city.  if you are a tourist only come here for drinks not food., another place i really want to love but it just never seems to cut it.  \\nthe bar itself looks great, the servers are attentive w/o being overbearing and they usually have pretty decent beers on tap. \\nbut the food is just awful.  i don\\'t know how you can serve an inedible burger but they manage to do it.  i used to like the pulled pork sandwich but they changed something and now it is terrible too. \\ni went back a couple of months ago as i heard they had a new chef  but the food was still just as terrible.  \\ncome on black sheep!  get a new food supplier and step it up a notch or three and you will be great!, baa baa black sheep, have you any stars?\\nyes sir, yes sir, two there are.\\none for johnny goodtimes\\none for the game [of quizzo],\\nno more than that cause this place is kind of lame. \\n\\nthe food is okay but quite overpriced for bar food. $7 for a dish of fries? and that\\'s the cheapest thing on the menu. outrageous. the beers could be cheaper as well. service can be spotty; i really dislike some of the servers here, but that may be partially a function of the fact that there tends to be only one server for the entire room. \\n\\nlike i said, quizzo is really the only reason to go to black sheep, but it fills up fast. you could get there an hour ahead of time and still not get a table. they need to better regulate pre-quizzo seating and direct non-quizzo patrons upstairs or downstairs. they also give one particular team unfair preferential treatment, because they\\'re \"regulars\". however, these \"regulars\" bring their own snacks and never end up paying for their beers because they always win. why such special treatment for some old dudes they\\'re not making any money off of? they must be bribing the staff with exorbitant tips (probably the majority of their winnings, since they don\\'t spend it on food and hardly buy any beer). not cool., we got a round of kamikaze shot and umm. it was very diluted. i was mad that i was drinking something like that for $6, at least it wasn\\'t charged more! i will get shots here again. and the waitress was so snobby. we went and sat at a table around 7-8pm and didn\\'t order food, just drinks. it was reunion of friends we haven\\'t seen for about a year and we just wanted to enjoy our time. everytime the waitress came over she asked in a tone as if she wanted us to leave if we weren\\'t gonna order more drinks. can you just let us enjoy our visit at black sheep and make it seem like we have to feel guilty? i heard good things about black sheep which is why i suggested this bar to my friends, but idk if i wanna come back again. it seems like a great bar but the whole experience of the waitress and diluted shots didn\\'t make our visit a good one., so, i usually like black sheep. i think they have a slightly above-average menu and they have that cute hostess with the tiny hats and the beer selection isn\\'t bad. \\n\\nbut then, i met michael.\\n\\nhe was our server the other day. and he was surly in a sarcastic way that made it difficult to tell if he was a tool, or if he was just joking. but, eventually, it became pretty clear: michael is just an outright dick.\\n\\nhe was slow to serve, but fast to remind us that \"the check is there. in case you were waiting for it. i already dropped it off\" about 5 minutes after he had  ostentatiously dropped it off. when we began the process of paying, he dropped by to challenge us \"keep it to one transaction. i haven\\'t had less than 4 cards per table all night\" despite the fact that we already had two cards out on the table. \\n\\nwhen he came back, he grabbed the cards (only 2!). and then he went quiet. he brought back our slips with no thank you, no have a good night, no nothing. so we signed, tipped, and left.\\n\\ni get it. it\\'s a tough job. i\\'ve done it and i sympathize. but as as server, you don\\'t get to demand sympathy. appreciate it when it happens. and when it doesn\\'t, shrug and smile. bottom line is i\\'m not 15. so, i don\\'t expect to be treated like i\\'ve never been to a restaurant without my mommy and daddy before.\\n\\nfor now, michael alone wasn\\'t enough to stop me from going there. but here\\'s a word of warning: if you walk in there and are sat in the section of a dude who looks like a brokedown will ferrell, ask to be moved -- or get ready to spar, if that\\'s what you\\'re into., overcharged my credit card via tips - what a scam. watch out for your statements!, we were a group of 10. a very short walk from our hotel. we all are airline employees. we were taken to the 2nd floor where our server kelly took great care of us. we had a couple rounds of beverages. after we asked if we could split the check and she said, \"no problem\".  we left and went elsewhere and had dinner where it was a problem. our group split in half and half went back to black sheep. all of us we just would have stayed there in the first place!!, hits, misses--altogether uneven. i ate here last night with a group of 8. the mediterranean appetizer was excellent and the brussels sprouts were pretty good. the nachos were gross, and unfortunately my main course--butternut squash risotto--was too. \\n\\ni was looking forward to a risotto made with pureed butternut squash. i\\'ve made that before at home. it\\'s delicious and not especially tough to make. what i got was a big mound of white risotto with one or two teeny cubes of squash mixed in. all i could taste was lots and lots of cream. it was terrible and heavy and just truly unappealing. serves me right for ordering risotto in a pub, i guess, but if you can\\'t make it properly, don\\'t put it on the menu!\\n\\nthe waiter was rather surly, too, and made us wait until he had retrieved every single drink and glass of water before we could place an appetizer order. \\n\\nif you go here, i\\'d suggest sticking with the basics: a burger, a beer, and maybe that lovely mediterranean plate. but if you can avoid going, i\\'d recommend that even more., the asian waitress is just racist. she tried to get my dad and me off our seats so she can offer them to caucasian customers., food was mediocre at best. i ordered the shepherds pie and it was basically soup. the service was also mediocre - not attentive., this is your classic pub with all of the normal pub \"stuff.\" there is a downstairs area with darts and other games. it can get crowded and smelly down there. the upstairs has a bunch of tables with flat screens with sports on.\\n\\ni\\'ve been here many times and on the latest occasion was there during the day for an actual meal. the food was not very good at all. the french toast was burnt and it did not come with the sides it said it did on the menu. by the time we got it, we had finished our french toast. would come here for the drinking, but not for the eating!, first time i ordered a drink ($7), paid with a 10 dollar bill, he didn\\'t give me change, second time, same drink, i paid with a $20, he gave me $10 back. it\\'s not hard math but 2 drinks $14 total, i paid $30. $6 may not be a lot, but no bartender should assume the tips! give the customer his change. like really?, tried to come in this bar tonight with my family and we asked if there was any place to sit.  the hostess seemed to not want to seat us when they saw i had my mother aunt and grandmother with me.  the hostess blocked the door and would not let us in so rude.  then a couple of young people came in and they got seated.  i would never go to that place again.  i think the reason was because of all of us were not young in our party.  i would rate it a minus 10., these dudes are so racist. i was not let in because i was indian, and thrown to the sidewalk because i was brown. never come here, i will give you 10 reasons why you\\'d never want to., bartenders were great. really did their best with the crowd. however the owner was not pleasant. was bleeding from broken glass and he came over and yelled at me to leave. would go for the bar staff but not for the owner., scattered service. first, i asked if i could get a smaller size beer (less than 12 oz) because i was trying to not drink that much. the server told me they could do that and proceeded to give me a 12 oz can! yikes.\\n\\ni have a dairy allergy and wanted a burger. the server put  my order in and 15 min later told me that all the buns had dairy. i asked if i could have it on any other bread. the server called someone who looked like a head chef. he very condescendingly told me my options were no bread or lettuce around the burger. they eventually figured that they could give me pita on the side.\\n\\nthis seems like an ok place if you have no specific food needs, but for me, it was not worth the effort. every single question i asked, the server had to check with the kitchen and the kitchen seemed pretty unaccommodating. once my food came, my fries came with a sauce with diary! um...., called, and they said they had quizzo. checked he website, had a specific entry for quizzo on the exact date. on facebook, there was a post \"quizzo tonight!\" but when i get there with my team of 6, bartender says \"\\'nah, no quizzo tonight. can i get you a menu?\" feel like there were several ways to alert customers of the change of plans, but instead they chose to allow people to arrive and hopefully just stay to spend money without getting what they came for. first and last time here i think., visited on a very warm friday evening.  our party of 10 quickly secured a table in the back and even annexed the adjacent table.  the waitress was attentive.  however, it was absolutely too hot without the merest hint of ac.  several in our party left due to just plain sweating too much.  as did the rest of our party a short time later.  clearly not a good place to visit when the temps get above 70.  see you in the fall black sheep., the bar tender was rude and unprofessional . the bar tender came out of the bar area, walked by us around the table . it was 5pm when we went after work, he groped my back and made inappropriate remarks . \\ndidn\\'t get a drink, left immediately, god i hate giving this 1 star because the bartenders are fantastic. i enjoy this place for the bartenders because they\\'re friendly and good.\\nbut the wait staff? \"rude\" doesn\\'t even begin to describe it.\\ni get it\\'s busy, but professionalism doesn\\'t go out the door. rachel was terrible. but the others were no treat to deal with either.\\njust pathetic., the food was great, but the waitress was so rude. she snatched things out of my hands a few times. walked away when i asked a question. not sure what i did to offend her, but she was really upset with me. she was to the table next to us., with so many other options in the general vicinity, black sheep just doesn\\'t excite me. the beer selection isn\\'t very vast, and the drafts seem overpriced, even for the location.  \\n\\nthe juke box is awful. it\\'s an internet juke, so while you do have the ability to select the songs you want to hear, it will cost double the credits, which adds up. the house selection includes top 40 stuff and some outdated albums from ten years ago.  \\n\\nit has been years since i\\'ve eaten at black sheep, which saves this review from dipping to two stars. if i were reviewing on bar alone, i\\'d go there, but since i understand that the kitchen is an attraction, i\\'ll stick with three. based on the other reviews, i feel like maybe i\\'m missing something and should probably give this place a chance... but it won\\'t be an easy sell getting me back in there., horrible place, horrible bartender. shitty food and joe was horrrible. kept trying to get us to leave, we were just trying to get a drink, pretty pricey for happy hour.  too much hassle about payment / cash rules.  too many better options in the vicinity to return., i have been drinking here a few time. probably a few more that i fail to remember. everytime that i can remember was great, and the one\\'s i can\\'t i might as well put them in the great column too.\\n\\nthe staff is pretty attentive and makes sure that if you want a drink that your glass never gets empty. seeing people doing the \"yeah pour me another\" head nod while they are taking the last sip of their beer is not an uncommon sight. \\n\\ni have no complaints until we get to the food. i figured after all this drinking i should try out their menu. granted the the prices are a little high, but when they bring out your food, well the servings are just sometimes ridiculously huge. so you\\'ll be getting a good deal for you buck. \\n\\nhowever i found the food to be mediocre. i had the potato soup a couple times. the first was just bland, no bad, but nothing to write home to yelp.com about. the second time it was so over flavored with onion they might as well have labeled in frenchy. aside from the soup i have ordered a burger and their more traditional irish dishes. i found that everything was just not memorable. sure i had a good time with friends and got some drink....but what did i order again? we ate right? \\n\\ni would say if you\\'re hungry, well then eat, but chances are you wont remember anything about it., band was dreadful!!!  beers overpriced! food was mediocre at best...the waitress was pleasant.  we won\\'t be returning anytime soon, i have not eaten yet but i can honestly say that our waitress is truly unprofessional. if you don\\'t want to serve people then get another job. when we walked in she didn\\'t want to seat us two adults and 4 children. told that the only table was in the back.  then rushed us on drink orders and the same thing when we ordered food. if the kids were not hungry i would have left sad service., i went to the rib house because of a suggestion by a friend. to sum it up i was less than pleased. \\n\\ni was a little shocked driving up as it did not really look like a restaurant it is more like a corner dive bar - which made no difference to me. i walked in and it definitely screamed dive bar - old, beat up and dated. i went there around lunch time on a weekday and saw many sitting at the bar. i opted for a table and was greeted and seated rather quickly. the server took our drink order and returned several minutes later and then returned much later - he was also the bartender. it was clear they were understaffed!  but he was definitely pleasant when we actually saw him. \\n\\ni ordered the spare ribs with fries and potato salad as my other side of choice was not available. my friend ordered the ribs and his 2 sides. we chose mild sauce but my friend informed him that he heard about another good sauce and the server quickly said hot honey and said he would bring some out so we could try it. \\n\\nour food came out and the appearance of it was not that appetizing and after eating it i was less than impressed. the french fries are those cheap crusty fries you see sometimes at pizza places and diners. the potato salad was weird it wasn\\'t creamy in the least. i\\'m not a fan of overly dressed potato salad with tons of mayo but this had no creaminess to it whatsoever. the texas toast served under the spare ribs was burnt, further it wasn\\'t texas toast more like typical white bread. you can tell the spare ribs were cooked with little sauce it tasted like they throw the sauce on it per order (you choose mild, hot or hot honey). the meat was tough i had to really work for it and i love spare ribs and it shouldn\\'t be that tough. i wasn\\'t a fan of the sauce again it felt like it was thrown on as ordered and didn\\'t cook and marinate in the sauce. portion sizes were generous. our server forgot to let us try the hot honey sauce so when my friend asked he brought it out and then when he got the bill i was a little surprised they charged us for the sauce considering it was our first time there and he implied we could try it. the cost was minimal but i\\'m a person of principle., not a restaurant but a bar with food. hope they do better at the bar since the food is deplorable. just saying., first time here, and i was very excited, since there is not alot of good bbq places around. i ordered the baby back pork ribs, and i was extremely disappointed. they were so dry and overcooked, i could not manually rip the meat apart with my fingers. i let the waitress know and showed her the meat, and her reply was, \"i can get you a knife to cut the meat...\" no thanks! if you need a knife to eat pork baby back ribs, theres a problem. the manager came by and offered me a togo box for my ribs, and i reiderated to her, that i did not want the ribs because they were so dry and overcooked, and she seem to entirely overlook what i had just said. i am a pretty fair patron, and usually dont complain at all, but when needed, i always give them the opportunity to make it right. between my waitress and the manager, they didnt even attempt to make it right, all they needed to do was offer to make me new ribs and that would have been great. now i am forced to leave this review, because i just wasted $60 on dry and overcooked meat, and those who served it to me, did not care., wow!! what a true shame!! even after all these years... so revolved around drugs. not just the patrons, but very much so... the staff!! just such a waste!! the food has just gone down hill. the service... well unless your known by someone, don\\'t expect to be served for quite some time. and i get you all love the music... but talk about overly loud and out of control. the old saying... all good things must come to an end... certainly applies here!! maybe after a stint at rehab and a new staff... you could always try again., i knew in advance what to expect in terms of atmosphere which is why ordered take-out in the middle of the day. that itself was a pretty eerie experience. the bartender was more than helpful and take out was quick. now i know the name of the joint has \\'rib\\' in it, but i\\'m always on the lookout for a decent brisket sandwich so i was eager to see how theirs measured up. sad to say that the first bite left me less than impressed. just bland, dry slices of chest meat. even drenching it in their mediocre bbq sauce didn\\'t help. maybe one day i\\'ll go back and actually try their ribs and this place will prove me wrong, but it won\\'t be any time soon., really??  the best you\\'ve had??  these were some of the worst ribs i\\'ve ever had.  i had high expectations based on the reviews, the fact that it has rib in the name, and the hickory smell as i approached.  although, should have been suspicious when we entered and we were the only ones in the dining area and there were two people sitting at the bar on a sunday around noon.  the turnout alone should have made me pull a 180 and exit right away.  i unfortunately ignored my instincts and tried to be optimistic which was a bad move.   anyways, we ordered a half a rack of baby backs and a half of spare ribs and split them between two people.  you get a side or two with each order but i wasn\\'t here for a side salad or french fries, i was here for the ribs.  the size was there - the spare ribs were huge and baby backs were good sized but the taste and tenderness wasn\\'t there.  they were large, fatty, tough and had a tiny hint of smoke.  the sauces were nothing to write home about either.  the best thing i had from here was a coke and the onion rings.  someone said better than sweet lucys?  they had to have went to a different sweet lucys or own this place bc no one would ever claim that.  maybe i had them on an extremely off day.  that being said i\\'ll probably give them a second chance....not!, i had the ribs and they were not good at all. they needed to be cooked longer because they were tough. i cant speak for the other food., if you like shitty china buffet style ribs...  you\\'ll love this place. the ribs are tough uncooked and they\\'re far from fall off the bone. bush\\'s baked beans... wow. the chicken pieces are also not cooked right, very greasy fatty didn\\'t taste like they were smoked at all and the skin was all fat and disgusting.   save your time and money., used to love it but really going downhill. awful steak and the stingiest salad i\\'ve ever been served. iceberg ain\\'t that expensive. it comes across as stingy., food here is awful.  i ordered a sandwich and the beef came out so chipped it was soggy...literally the consistency of a liquid.  my wife ordered an entree she couldn\\'t eat one bit of.  i\\'d be embarrassed to serve people food so carelessly made., first it charges 3% if you use your credit card. the prime rib was totally bland with american cheese. the ribs were ok. and the pork nachos were all broken pieces!! don\\'t go, bbq needs more than sauce. no  seasoning on the chicken and the chicken was undercooked. ribs were ok but i\\'ve had a lot better. do it well or don\\'t do it at all!, this place is a dog! the prices for a hillbilly type outfit are rdiculous...it wont . the prices are out of sight the decor ,jersey pinelands have bettershacks .who prices mediocre ,pre cooked ribs and who the hell buys them....., the baby back ribs were the worst i have ever had... and the same says my 93yo father-in-law.  meat stuck to bone. dry. basically no flavor. onion rings sucked. baked beans nothing special.  band was setting up and were making sound checks which was rude. diet pepsi was tasteless and flat.  miller lite on tap flat. \\n\\nservice was terrible, slow, nonchalant. sadly, i ate here once before and loved it.  will not return., poor waitress service.  cramped dark dining area.  food is ok.  mostly fried foods or sandwiches., you do not want to go here. i could kick myself for not listening for the other negative reviews. if i could give zero stars i would!!! \\nthe place is filthy dirty and the wait staff is incredibly rude. my waitress literally made me feel like she was doing  me a favor to serve me. i iiterally could not wait to leave. also.... my husband ordered a drink and paid cash..... it was on my bill and they also charged my credit card.  watch your bill!!!! we ended up paying double cause it wasn\\'t worth the argument.  the place is over rated big time., loved the ribs but my child\\'s hearing was damaged by the afternoon singo band. (they were awful)\\n\\nobserved the bartender continue to serve a visibly intoxicated female that was slurring, hope this place has good insurance., food is alright more of a bar than anything else!!! i will say this owner if you read this every fuk or bitch that is scream across your establishment. .. the more people walk away from here and dont look back !!! i saw it with my own eyes.. lady was about 80 yrs young and was cringing every curse word said control da drunks and you could do alright. . im not mad cause.....despite my rage ...im still just a rat in a cage!!!, wow. talk about a downward spiral. lazy or bad cook. i\\'ll leave it to you. ordered a chicken leg and rib platter, side of cole slaw and potato salad. platter came out. ribs thermonuclear, obviously microwaved. yes, microwaved ribs. more like rib jerky. chicken looked more like pigeon parts, and were lukewarm, probably because they started out cold but the microwaved ribs warmed them up. cole slaw was nothing but shredded, dry cabbage. i guess he forgot the cole and the slaw. potato salad well salted. didn\\'t know that was part of the recipe. ugh. used to love this place. not any more., my family and i have been trying many local bbq so we could decide on a caterer for an up coming event we are having. unfortunately bridgeport rib house is not going to be who we choose. they rely on the sauce instead of the meat for the flavor of the food. the spare ribs were fatty and on both the spare ribs and the baby back ribs the membranes were left on prior to cooking.  the chicken had an odd texture. their stuffing was okay. pasta salad over cooked pasta. the cole slaw had no taste at all. the baked beans tasted straight from the can except they had cut up onions in them., had the pork nachos and they made me feel like shit honestly. had some awful heartburn / diarrhea after. i\\'d stay away, had some high expectations for this place with the reviews i read and the opinions i heard and i ended up highly disappointed. we ordered baby back ribs and there was a good portion but the ribs were dry as anything. we ordered hot honey sauce and the sauce overtook the flavor of the ribs. ironically, the macaroni salad and coleslaw lacked flavor. \\nour waitress was neglectful and a bit rude. when she brought our food she gave us napkins and then walked away with us sitting there like \"where are our utensils?\" and when i asked her politely for some forks she responded with \"no, you have to eat with your hands\" really sarcastically then brought us our forks.  then we asked for the check which took a good 20 minutes. we practically ran out of there and we\\'re never coming back., i\\'m not a snob and will go anywhere for good ribs. this pit is not that place., i ordered a chicken breast platter with stuffing and potatoe salad since they had no vegetables other than garden salad. the stuffing and potatoe salad was awwwwful! chicken was dry and not spicy. hopefully they do better with drinks. they should fire the cook!! will not return for the food that\\'s for sure., if you\\'re looking for good ribs in the area you\\'re sol. this is one of the only rib spots that isn\\'t a chain and it\\'s honestly god awful. this has been the second time i was here for ribs, i wanted to give it a chance (first got the spare, this time the baby back). when you get ribs you want a meaty bite with give and a clean bone every single time. you aren\\'t gonna get that here. you\\'re going to get something that\\'s worse than any chain restaurant could microwave for you at their place.. the ribs were so tough to eat it\\'s actually a sin to call it a rib house. texture 1/10, flavor 4/10, value 2/10. if anyone has an actual recommendation for ribs that isn\\'t here or mission bbq please let me know. the shining part of my new was their corn bread, went here for the second time and remembered why we hadn\\'t ordered takeout from here in awhile. the sides are ridiculously small! why on earth would i want a bunch of ribs and hardly anything on the side? the ribs were pretty good though, just not enough sides for a family of four. also the sides aren\\'t that good. this is not baked mac and cheese and the baked beans taste unseasoned and canned., what the heck is happening with this place. we brought some friends there the other night and there literally no plates to eat your food off of. literally. they we\\'re using the lids to the take out containers. i mean how had would it have been to run down to target to pick something up. disappointing and disrespectful. love the food and the servers. this one\\'s on the owner., what reviewer would drop their rating from five stars to one? it must be unheard of in the annals of yelp. i wouldn\\'t be doing it if it wasn\\'t deserved.  after years of offering a very good hot sauce, you now have two choices: mild honey or hot honey.  what if customers don\\'t like honey on their ribs? i guess they\\'re sol. if i wanted honey on my ribs i\\'d buy some garbage sauce off the shelf at giant.  i loved this place but they\\'ve lost my business., i\\'m still on a rib binge and i stopped by the bridgeport rib house to get my groove on.\\ni didn\\'t read any yelp reviews and i wanted to experience the b.r.h. unencumbered.\\nb.r.h. is a small neighborhood spot with a dining area, a bar and a few tv\\'s to catch the game on. the atmosphere is nice with a little redneck-ish thrown in.\\nhere\\'s why i gave them only 2 stars......the ribs......they were as tuff as shoe leather with no sauce to speak of. i cannot believe this is what they produce on a regular basis.\\npork ribs are supposed to be tender and smoked, not tuff and dry. i felt like an animal try to rip the meat off the bone. the side orders were nothing special either. \\nnot good, not good at all., the spare ribs are good, most everything else is sub-par. \\n\\nthe chicken was dry as a bone.  the pieces of chicken breast were flat and hard, i wasn\\'t even sure at first what they were.  \\n\\nthe sides are bland.  the cole slaw was oddly think.\\n\\nthere was some odd at the bottom of my sampler i couldn\\'t quite make out.  then i realized it was the \"texas toast\".  after scraping it off the bottom of the container it appears to be a very thin slide of plain bread soggy with sauce from everything sitting on it.  maybe someone should look up what texas toast is.\\n\\ndo yourself a favor and save your money., male bald bartender has some serious anger issues.  your job is to make people feel welcome.  i get it\\'s a dive bar, but have some standards.   i had a hair in my food and they treated me like i was a nuisance for requesting something new.  thanks for the good times., very disappointed in the service and food at this location.  sadly would not be able to recommend it in good conscience. \\ni absolutely love the location in rittenhouse square, and will continue to frequent them. \\nhowever, nothing seems to be going well at this new location in norristown.\\n\\ntonight was my second experience-the first being a take-out order of zil zil tibs. the beef was tough and not flavorful, the vegetables were undercooked. \\nthis evening i ordered the vegetarian combo plate, and it was better on the whole, but not to the standard that i expected from the center city location.\\nthe vegetables tasted like they were at least a couple of days old, and the njera tasted the same. not fresh, not warm, and not soft. it actually left a brown residue on my fingers when i tore small pieces off of it... strange, this has never happened before anywhere!\\n\\nadded to the subpar quality of the food, i made the mistake of using the restroom. neither of the stall doors of the women\\'s restrooms locked, and it was a nightmare trying to keep my one-year-old son contained during the process. there was no toilet paper in my stall either...\\n\\nthe man who appeared to be the owner was very friendly, but our waiter was a bit... preoccupied? the food came out relatively quickly, no more than 15 minutes, but as we were the only year diners in the entire place i had hoped for something a touch faster. \\n\\nwhen i told the waiter i was finished, i expected him to return with the check. after about five minutes passed and i saw him still standing behind the bar talking with the only other patron, i decided to pack up and take matters into my own hands.\\ni went up to the bar and asked if i should just pay there - he replied, \"yes\" and i finished up our evening with a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.\\n\\ni really hope this location picks up, and that they begin to spend a bit more time on their food and on their environment.  i absolutely love the center city location, and i was really hoping that this location would provide the same high-quality food and good service that i was used to there., used.to be good for ethiopian good, but no longer serving ethiopian food.  they might still serve bar fare though ., be warned that this place does not serve food at all and is not friendly to non-neighborhood locals.\\n\\nthey no longer serve food at all and have not updated their website or any other identifying information. we found out by walking in the door and being turned away., tried to go at noon on a monday. they were closed. no hours posted and their phone was disconnected. i suspect that they may have just shut down, though it\\'s also possible they\\'re just not open on mondays. in either event, you might want to call before you make plans to go there., sure, this is passable. i stopped in the other evening to burn some time. found it hard to get acknowledged at first; the first waiter clearly didn\\'t want to be there and demonstrated this by ignoring me. second waiter was quite friendly and service was on point other than the mysterious lack of silverware and napkins. i had a sausage/peppers sandwich which was good, so no utensils required i guess. when i asked for napkins i got a pile of bar napkins although other tables had cloth. whatever.\\n\\nthe sidewalk table was pleasant, selection of beers on tap was okay, sandwich was decent, fries were your standard mealy bar fries. i\\'d go back and try the pizza instead next time. would have given it another star if it hadn\\'t taken over 30 minutes to get my check -- waiter was awfully busy putting the moves on the two college girls who sat down at the next table, and once they showed up the service took a sharp decline. oh, well., i ordered the caesar salad, it was overdressed, and the lettuce couldn\\'t hold up to the  bath. the dressing was generic mass produced dressing, but i didn\\'t really expect otherwise at such a low cost. i also had the chicken wings which had very little meat, and the meat the was on the bones was dry. the sauce was standard. there were ten pieces, but i would rather have half the number with meaty wings then what looks like a plate full of food. maybe the pizza here is better than the rest of the menu, but i\\'m not going to come back to find out. i can\\'t respect a business that neglects the rest of their menu.\\n although the cost is low here, the quality of my food was lower for that reason i can\\'t recommend this place. there are better finds at low prices in other places around philadelphia., based on what the others are saying about lulu\\'s being closed... it\\'s really a shame. this was my favorite downtown pizza spot. i\\'m not surprised though because i\\'ve never seen this place poppin. i can at least say that much about soho down the street. i think lulu\\'s is a victim of circumstance. if it was in a more residential neighborhood, it would be... the place to be. i suppose the whole setup was too nice for pizza and drinks., i really hate to write a bad review but i feel obliged to share our experience... i won\\'t go into too much detail so here were the pros and cons of our night:\\n\\npros\\nnice location\\ngood ambience (indoor and outdoor dining)\\ndecent prices\\n\\ncons\\npizza by the slice was hardly heated (if heated at all - they were room temp)\\nwe were shorted a side salad (was forgotten from our order by the staff)\\nstaff were a bit abrupt and not friendly (to other customers near me as well as to me)\\nwe ordered an antipasto that did not list olives yet had at least half a dozen in it (ordered this particular antipasto because the menu listed mushrooms and not olives - it had no mushrooms, just olives.)\\nthere was a dog in the front that kept barking which seemed unusual for a somewhat \"upscale\" establishment - it was the owner\\'s dog it seems. \\n\\nwe definitely had high hopes for this place after reading the reviews and we\\'re by no means picky when it comes to food.. this was just pretty much an overall letdown., this place sucks, there are much better options within a block. first of all, the customer service is terrible, they forgot to even prepare my food and when i asked about it the guy called my a f**king pussy, i was shocked, truly horrible. clearly this guy has issues with his own insecurities  and has a lot he needs to work out.  when i finally did get the food, it was cold, they use a little micro oven to heat old stale slices, it was small for what i generally expect when getting a slice, soggy, and too sweet.   if you are looking for a late night slice and you are drunk and don\\'t care what you are getting go for it, if you value decency and have a certain set of standards, go elsewhere.\\ni\\'d rate zero stars if i could, lulu\\'s is off grubhub and they aren\\'t picking up their phone.\\n\\nplease don\\'t be dead, lulu. please. you can\\'t leave me with these inferior margherita pizzas. i\\'ll never be the same.\\n\\ncall me?\\ntext?\\ne-mail?\\nlet me know you\\'re alright., fries soggy and cold, cheese steak cold,  45 mins late and i only live a quarter mile away.  absolutely horrible. only 1 delivery driver on a sunday afternoon, ordered a cheesesteak and seasoned fries delivered from a few blocks away, it wasn\\'t cheap and the fries had no seasoning on them. the worst part was the delivery guy basically robbed me. i have him a $20 and he told me he didn\\'t have any change because he was robbed. i told him he could come back with change since it\\'s only a few blocks away but he just tuned and walked away. needless to say i will never order from there again!!, ordered from them at 9 on a monday from grub hub, food never showed.. don\\'t order from this dump..it\\'s one thing to order and never show up, it\\'s another to charge you on grub hub, then never show up.. because now i have to call the ever on hold customer service line to try and get a refund that won\\'t get back on my card for another week!, they used to be the best, with higher quality sandwiches and poutine..not the same exact menu as every other pizza place on the ave...then they shut down without as much as a phone recording to let customers know....they reopened for a a really short period of time with a crappier menu, cheaper prices but very poor quality--and two weeks later it\\'s closed again....there\\'s a thousand regular pizza places to choose from in mayfair--it\\'s a shame we don\\'t have any unique places left, very disappointed. brand new place, awesome reviews, over priced meals. fries were soggy and half done - lacking taste and salt. mild wings were meaty but flavor was odd, like a thick spicy cheese. burger was average tasting. delivery was average in timing. counter girl that took the order seemed slow or new. way over priced though. i could have ordered better food closer to my house for cheaper. won\\'t be ordering from here again. i don\\'t understand how they have all of these great reviews., was very disappointed. burger was undercooked fries were soggy and the wings had no flavor . the only thing that was good was the 2 liter of coke, used to be one of my favorite spots in the northeast. but has not been good the last two times. i had a caesar salad today. shrimp smelled bad and didn\\'t taste good either. dressing was heavy and lacked flavor.\\n\\nbefore that i had a slice of sicilian pizza. i almost threw up., this place has gone downhill fast. when it first opened, it was consistently good, whether ordering a pizza, sandwich or poutine fries. all this being said, the regular pizza with sausage that i ordered on july 5th was possibly the worst pizza i have ever had. the cheese blend managed to be completely flavorless despite having about 3 times too much. the sparsely used tomato sauce also had no flavor whatsoever. the slices of sausage were fine but sausage crumbles work better on pizza. the crust was so thin and undercooked towards the middle of the pie that when we picked up a slice, the bland glob of cheese would slide right off. flavorless and poorly put together. what a dissapointment. i had high hopes for them., it was ok.... the pizza was under cooked and the fries were over cooked! prob won\\'t try this place again! i\\'ll stick with tony\\'s and charlie\\'s for pizza!, disappointed with this place. had vey high hopes. the girl at the front counter was very nice and helpful. now on to the food. got the texas fries.  the fries were nasty.  the oil was old and you can tell. the fries were just nasty.  the short rib was good the fries itself we\\'re very very salty and the cheese curds were interesting overall not a fan. i also got the mojito cherry wings. very strange and sorry but those flavors just didn\\'t taste well and was very strange. the pineapple soy wings were ok but were lacking flavor.  overall i wasn\\'t impressed and i don\\'t think i\\'ll be coming back., so it\\'s been a while since we ordered from here and decided to give it another try last week. well...apparently they raised their prices. i was floored when the girl told me my total. i actually had to call back to make sure i heard her correctly (i wish i would have cancelled it right then) the salads were both watery, and came without a roll (really? for 11 bucks each you can\\'t send a roll and butter?) and for 2 orders of wings, we got 4 (yes 4) carrot sticks ( and no celery). i would rather go out to dinner than spend almost 50 bucks for delivery from a frankford ave pizza place. (yes commonwealth, you are a pizza place on the ave, so price accordingly). won\\'t be ordering again.., out of business, he closed the doors oweing a lot of people money, i have to add more words or they wont post this, such nonsense the place is out of business, more words words words, my husband and i went here on a friday evening. a woman cut right in front of us as we walked up to the hostess stand and got her party of four promptly seated. we then walked up to the hostess. they had six tables open as well as people finishing their meals at several other tables. yet they insisted they could only seat us outside (it was a torrential downpour with thunder and lightning) or at the sushi bar. when we asked about how long it would be to wait for a table they first said about 30 minutes which we agreed to (despite there being 6 open tables) yet then a moment later the manager came over and said it was not possible to wait for a table.\\n\\nwhile i can not comment on the quality of food i can say their service is absolutely horrendous. i can not fathom why it was impossible to seat us at a table despite the 6 open tables or allow us to wait for one yet we could sit out in the storm or at the bar. i will not be returning here., went there after watched the show. place was half empty and we saw people were eating korean bi bim bop in hot stone bowl. maybe it\\'s korean owned sushi place or at least be of chefs is korean. \\ni got sashimi salad and roll without rice. sashimi salad was sooooooooo spicy even to me. i can handle some spicy but this was just pure go chu jang ( korean red chilly pepper paste) i had to take out most of sauces and ate them. sashimi was ok but their sauce already burned my tongue couldn\\'t taste anything., ordered from here twice. poor customer service and unimpressive fish. \\n\\nthe sushi was very meh the first time, but my roommate and i decided to give them one more try based on reviews. i think a lot of people leaving the good reviews have never had good sushi because makiman is definitely sub par. \\n\\nanyway, the second time i ordered some kind of fancy/special shrimp tempura roll and a salmon avocado roll. i don\\'t know how hot the tempura roll was when they packaged it, but it made the salmon roll really warm. not the rice, but the whole thing. warm raw fish is not good and it grossed me out to where i couldn\\'t eat it. i could have let this slide, but they also gave me a regular shrimp tempura roll instead of the one i ordered and paid for that cost double. i gave them a call about the roll and mentioned the warm salmon. the guy was super rude and told me that he\\'s \"been packaging sushi for 10 years and no one ever complained about this.\" ok, jerk. i\\'ve been eating sushi for 10 years and never complained about this because it\\'s never happened. \\n\\nhe told me he would credit the extra $7 for the shrimp tempura from my next order. told him there would be no next order after the conversation we just had and he said ok and hung up., picked up the same lunch special i enjoyed in the restaurant this past saturday on my way to the bolt bus and was very disappointed. the salmon was spoiled and inedible and the yellowtail was questionable at best.\\n\\nthe miso soup was tasty, and the spicy tuna roll was great again, but going 1/3 is certainly not a win in my book.\\n\\nwill return again because of my positive first experience, but may have given up on take-out for now., currently, makiman makes me angry, but i would be willing to give them another chance.  it was a friday night, and katrina c. and i wanted to grab a quick dinner before a party.  we were in a hurry, so we figured if we ordered take out it would be faster.  i asked the hostess if that was true and she said yes.  they had several specials with crab in them, and i had a groupon so i was willing to splurge on the fancy sushi.  we ordered and then sat down to wait.  probably 25 minutes go by and the waitress comes over to tell katrina they are out of crab, and she has to pick a different roll.  now, they didn\\'t say anything to me, so we figured i must have gotten the last of it.  well, about 10 minutes later the waitress came to let me know that two of the rolls i ordered were no longer available.  i replaced one with something different, and requested that the other just have the crab changed to something else.  about 15 minutes after that, we finally got our food.  it took about 45 minutes for this process to go down, which caused us to be really late for the party, so we actually requested to just sit at a table and eat our food instead of taking it with us.    we specifically told them we had to be somewhere before ordering, so they should have just said they couldn\\'t accommodate us.  also, probably not a good idea to make crab the ingredient in every roll, and then not have enough.  i have no major complaints about the sushi, although apparently the spicy salmon was lacking in spice.  it didn\\'t wow me though, and without a groupon, i won\\'t be back., service was fine and it\\'s nice that it\\'s a byo but i was super disappointed with the sushi here. it all tasted like it had seen better days- even the spicy tuna which generally can hide sub par fish with the spicy sauce. there are much better byo sushi places in philly, i would for sure skip this one., just went in for the saturday lunch special (10/14) and ordered the two roll special - 2 spicy tuna rolls, a salmon avocado roll, and an eel avocado roll. the avocado was rotten. i immediately informed the waitress (although how the sushi chef served that is beyond me) - it was disgusting and we could have easily gotten food poisoning if i hadn\\'t noticed it. it has made me question the quality of all of the ingredients they use. on top of that, it took the sushi chef an additional 20 minutes to make us our sushi rolls again (we were the only people in the restaurant). and the icing on the cake is that there was no discount, comp, free appetizer, anything offered to make up for serving us rotted food. will never go here again., went to makiman tonight for the first time, mainly because i had a groupon for dinner. i hate to write a bad review, mainly because the servers were great  (very attentive and friendly), unfortunately, the food was pretty bad. the miso soup was watery and flavorless, the ginger salad dressing was ok, but not great and even the green tea was disappointing. they made a whole pot of tea with one tea bag, so it basically was like drinking hot water. my main dish was the salmon stone pot. the salmon was fine but the dish overall really lacked flavor despite dousing it with the two sauces served with it. my date had sushi and a special spicy tuna tempura appetizer. the sushi was mediocre but she really enjoyed the tuna appetizer. i think that appetizer and the service were the only good things about the meal! i won\\'t be going back., this is the first  and more than likely the last time i will order from makiman sushi.  simply put, i was very disappointed and felt totally ripped off!  never have i paid so much for so little  that was so average., i went to makiman tonight.  service sucked, sushi was, at best, mediocre.  i don\\'t know what possessed me to get \"mama\\'s roll\", but it was inedible.  i did manage to eat the rest of the other rolls.  the sushi was just kinda sloppy and definitely didn\\'t taste fresh.  best part of the dish was the pork dumpling soup as an appetizer.  i have high standards because umai umai is my favorite place on earth...this wasn\\'t in the same league.  will not go back., really the sushi isn\\'t so bad. although they seem to drench everything in spicy sauce, many of the rolls were quite tasty. the real disappointment (and the reason for the 3) was the pork tonkatsu. it was god awful! the pork was a soggy mess with a sad sad egg placed on top. i love tonkatsu for the cripsy tempura coating on the pork, but here it was just a soggy mess. don\\'t think i\\'ll return for any sort of entree item, but if you like your sushi with a bit of sauce, than this is the place for you., i had sushi delivered from makiman.  i used the online ordering system and it worked well.  my order was delivered on time and the gentleman was very nice.  i opened the package and found everything i would need - napkin, chopsticks, soy.  \\n\\nthe seaweed salad was blah.  no cucumbers or carrots, just seaweed nothing great.  i ordered two rolls and 4 pieces of nigiri.  i love unagi so i ordered and unagi roll with avocado and 2 pieces of unagi.  my first bite into the nigiri unagi was not good.  it was fatty and tough - not how unagi should taste.  i tried the roll and couldn\\'t eat the whole thing due to the poor quality of the unagi. \\n\\nthe hamachi nigiri was also tough and i feel was cut very thin and small.  the raw viking was a nice roll but it is advertised as having green and red tobiko on top but it only had red tobiko on it.  \\n\\noverall, i wouldn\\'t order from makiman again.  the quality and value aren\\'t there., absolutely disgusting.  i foolishly bought a groupon for this place, and recently redeemed it.  \\n\\ni ordered the sashimi sampler.  the fish was so old, discolored and nasty i could only eat about half of it.  nasty is actually an understatement... this fish was downright scary.  \\n\\nthe yellowtail tuna was nearly grey, with a disturbingly fishy taste.  the salmon had no overtly disgusting  flavor (making it one of the better bites on the plate) but instead had absolutely no flavor whatsoever, as well as a weird off putting texture.  you have no idea how much i regret even sampling the mucous-y, overwhelmingly fishy squid.  this meal was so bad i really didn\\'t even feel like revisiting it in order to write this, but i thought you, dear reader, deserved this public service announcement.  \\n\\navoid makiman at all costs.  i would tell you to go to vic\\'s instead, but really, go anywhere instead.  i\\'ve never had worse sushi in my entire life., apparently, bad service and customer service in general is a hallmark of this place.   we will not be going back., my husband and i visited makiman before seeing a ballet at the academy of music. it was completely dead for lunch and we were the only people at the restaurant. this is a korean and japanese restaurant so there is japanese cuisine like sushi and ramen, and korean cuisine like kimchi and bibimap. i order the miso ramen, my husband ordered the stone bowl bibimap. service was slow, especially considering we were the only ones at the restaurant. when we received our meals, i was disappointed. the ramen was not very good, the hard boiled egg was incredible hard and chewy. the pork belly was too thick and fatty. my husband\\'s stone bowl bibimap was barely hot. usually the bibimap sort of cooks in the bowl but this was just bibimap thrown in a barely warm stone bowl.\\n\\nthe price was fine but i was just overall disappointed with the food and experience., the restaurant is currently closed. the website is still live and you are able to place online orders through the site, your food will obviously not be delivered. your credit card will still be charged. be aware, don\\'t order online., we went on a monday night for the all you can eat sushi.  it was good but when we went to give them our living social coupon they said it can\\'t be used on the all you can eat special even thought it says nothing on the all you can eat rules card at the table or on the coupon itself about not being able to use it for specials.  this was extremely irritating.  now we have to go back sometime just to use the coupon., very bad. nothing really good to write about. the girls working there have no idea what they\\'re doing, the food is really not that good, everything kind of taste like either hot or cold mush. too bad it so conveniently close., i have been to this place a few times to dine in and enjoyed their specialty rolls but today i placed an order for take out and ended up throwing away half of my meal because i got sick from the other half!!!! i used to recommend this place to my friends but never again!! i ordered the yellow stallion and something else for take out. the yellow tail on top of the roll looked half cooked and fish looked greyish red. totally not fresh!! i have ordered this same roll before while dining in and it looked totally different!  i am so disappointed because i enjoyed this byob place before i experienced their take-out service., the worst sushi i have ever had in my entire life, including a chinese restaurant down in south philly. way over pricedfor the quality, fish was not fresh and super fishy tasting (in rolls not as sashimi), the service is terrible here. we went for a friend\\'s birthday and we had to ask for every single thing - menus, water, wine opened, silverware, plates, etc. it\\'s a shame because the sushi is actually pretty good. never going back here again. there are too many good byob sushi restaurants in this city to waste money on a bad one., not my favorite.  we went because we had a livingsocial deal, and i wouldn\\'t go back.  the sushi was fine and not extremely overpriced, but it was the atmosphere that lost it for me.\\n\\nloud, and not in a good way, with a lot of families with small kids.  maybe we went at the wrong time.  also, the place is byob, which we found to our dimay when we tried to order a bottle of saki.  is that their fault? no, but it put a damper on dinner.  all in all, find a different place for sushi., i come with  my friend in here two time,fist time is ok ,this time some fish no fresh at all,i just tried for fish no fresh,service is ok.roll is too small,no more rice from the roll,thanks..........\\n.., after my favorite sushi place closed down earlier this year i embarked on a journey to find a new spot. i had heard some good things about makiman so i decided to give them a try... i now regret that decision. my friend and i were sat down and then ignored for 15 minutes before someone came to take our order. we ordered one of their sushi boats and when it finally arrive almost 45 minutes later it was terribly disappointing. nothing tasted fresh and when added to the poor service this is a definite skip me in the future., i\\'ve never left a one star yelp review, and i\\'ve never had a bad tuna roll.. until tonight.  my wife and i each ordered the \"sushi deluxe\" - which is 10 pieces of sushi plus one tuna roll.  \\n\\nbefore the plates even hit the table, they smelled like old nasty fish.  like the italian market on a hot sweltering day.  \\n\\ni hoped the smell came from a new piece of sushi that we weren\\'t familiar with yet, but no.  everything was terrible, even the tuna and salmon (which is usually always so reliably tasty).\\n\\nthis is seriously the worst sushi place i\\'ve been to in center city.  very disappointed.  left most of my plate untouched and had to go across the street to get a sandwich at jay\\'s deli afterwards.\\n\\nthe other annoying thing was that the waiter went into hiding after we told him it wasn\\'t very good.  he wouldn\\'t make eye contact afterwards, and we had to hunt down an employee after waiting 30 minutes for the check.\\n\\nthis place is the worst., do i like it raw? yes.\\ndo i like terrible service? no.\\n\\ni previously ordered take out from makiman. being satisfied with my order, i decided to dine in the following week with my partner. the futo maki roll was my favorite, but ended up falling apart due to it being insufficiently rolled. the rest of my rolls were pretty average. \\n\\ni would\\'ve given makiman an average review, but the service made me feel very unwanted. \\n\\nour server was completely apathetic. we were their only table and we still felt unwelcomed. they did the bare minimum while serving us, which i would expect if the restaurant was busy - but c\\'mon, we\\'re only a two top and we\\'re easy to please. \\n\\nafter dining, i asked them about the 10% off yelp check-in offer. our server was completely oblivious and asked their coworkers. i overheard one of them saying \"i don\\'t know, just pretend that you don\\'t know what yelp offer they\\'re talking about.\" not a direct quote, but still, if you\\'re going to be sarcastic/throw shade at your customer, do it after they leave. also, do they not know how sound travels, especially in an empty restaurant? common sense now! they ended up taking the yelp offer, but i rather would have saved my 10% for better service. \\n\\ni would also like to note that our server did not have their hair (which was way past shoulder length) pulled up. isn\\'t this a minimum requirement for servers?\\n\\nword of advice: since you have a \"people love us on yelp\" sticker, please be aware of the offers you put on your yelp page., this is a review for their all you can eat...monday only from 3pm onward. the fish is fresh but the rules are a bummer. 3 orders at a time...they are pushing you toward ordering the rolls. can you imagine getting only 6 pieces of nigiri per order?!? they is no way in hell you can eat a large quantity. another rule is that you can\\'t order the next round until you are totally done. if you want lots of sushi for all you can eat, expect to spend hours here. if you want all you can eat, go to aki instead., i wish i could give this place zero stars.  \\n1.  service was incredibly slow even though there weren\\'t many people here.\\n2.  there was very little meat in every dish we ordered -- two rolls and a korean dish.\\n3.  the salad we got had pieces of rotten lettuce in it.  it wasn\\'t edible.\\n\\ni wish this place would go out of business because it\\'s doing philly a disservice., went in at around 3:30/4pm on a sunday and was the only customer in the restaurant. they tucked me away in a corner and completely neglected me for the entire meal, i had to get out of my seat to request more water as the waitresses and bartender chatted in the back.\\n\\ni came in specifically to order the ramen burger. it comes in a foil wrapping to hold it together. the ramen noodles are fried to a crispness so it tasted less like noodles and more like a thin crunchy bun. there is a barely cooked egg that covers absolutely everything in yolk which smells really strong and makes for one of the messiest meals in my life. i honestly don\\'t remember much of the taste other than the egg yolk.\\n\\nit might be easier if they give up on making the ramen burger something you eat with your hands and just present it as a fork-knife meal., ordered delivery from here on a tuesday night through grubhub. estimated about an hour for delivery and they hit the mark pretty close.  my first impression upon unwrapping the food was:  why are these rolls so tiny, and did they really need to give us soy sauce packets?\\n\\nthe fish was of pretty good quality, the yellowtail particularly being the freshest i\\'ve had in a while, but my major issue with the sushi was the rice.  it was all wrong: hard, bland, cold, but thankfully not abundant.  thinking about that rice still makes me shudder; it ruined the whole experience for me.  the fish portion in the rolls is pretty generous aside from the rolls being somewhat smaller than i\\'m used to, but there was some unevenness to their slicing technique so a few pieces were all rice and avocado with hardly any fish.  \\n\\naltogether we ordered dumpling soup, yellowtail scallion, salmon avocado, salmon cucumber, tuna avocado, a rainbow roll, and a special roll i can\\'t remember.  the soup was not very successful.  the dumpling wrappers became mushy and fell apart in the broth, the filling wasn\\'t very cohesive, and the broth was overly smoky miso-flavoured without the cloudy deliciousness of a good miso soup.  \\n\\nely enjoyed his special roll the most, and from looking at other reviews and the photos on their hardcopy menu that the delivery guy brought, this seems to be their forte.  however, i find the lack of quality in the standard roll offerings to be a definite deal-breaker, as when i order sushi i\\'m not interested in spending $10+ dollars/roll for rolls filled with fried things and spicy mayo.  terryin has not yet been overthrown as our go-to sushi delivery joint even despite their recent quality issues.  if i\\'m going to get hit-or-miss sushi, i\\'d rather spend a dollar less per roll., tried this with a groupon for the first time last nigh.  never again.  the poorest service i\\'ve ever had in the city: ignored upon entry- took forever to be seated in an empty restaurant. it then took forever for someone to take our order... at which point, they got it wrong. i had to wait an additional 20 minutes for them to get the right order.  the starter came after the mains (i had to remind them to bring it) and it took forever to get a drink..or a napkin...or...anything. \\n\\nfood was so-so. not terrible- not that good. only 4 shrimp on the shrimp tempura dinner... bi bim bop in hot stone bowl...served in a tepid bowl. \\n\\nnever again., groupon saves a lot of asses, including this place.\\n\\nmaybe 2 stars, but the service sucked. \\n\\ni didn\\'t have high expectations, and still i was disappointed.\\n\\nservice is slow and somewhat apathetic (i didn\\'t know who our waitress was for 15 minutes, water took another 15... etc) to the point that i wanted to go old school korean and tap my chopsticks on the empty glass of water. the table in front of us was not wiped down until right before a customer came (which was almost at the end of our meal).\\n\\nappetizer: the tuna nachos- promising, but too much sauce and not enough fish. \\n\\nwe got the sushi boat for 2, the mcnabb roll, new england roll, shrimp tempura maki roll, and all were just blah. if i had to choose, the best of the 3 was the mcnabb.\\n\\nthe salad that came out looked like the dressing and the components were all assembled in the morning (it looked flat). the miso soup was just ok.\\n\\nthe sushi is not fresh. it looked and tasted like it\\'s been precut and been sitting out for a while. the salmon sushi was odd (i should\\'ve taken a picture of it) because it was sliced so thin that the rice was showing between the fenestrations of the fish.\\n\\nluckily, we had a groupon. otherwise, i would\\'ve been considerably angry after my meal., the first dish was served with rancid oil\\nthe order was wrong\\nthe fish tasted fishy\\nthe soy sauce was \"off\"\\nthe rolls didn\\'t taste right. \\nthe mochi ice cream was even bad. i didn\\'t think you could screw something up that comes from a box\\nthey were nice and took the rancid order off the bill, but i would never come back. probably the worst sushi i\\'ve ever had., this is one of the hardest ratings i have had to come up with. my experience can definitely be summed up as hit or miss. \\n\\nhits: outdoor seating, byob, the shrimp tempura, \\n\\nmisses: the quality/freshness of fish, corking fees, service\\n\\ni checked this place out because i had a groupon but don\\'t think i will be back. maybe i caught them on a bad night but the fish didn\\'t cut it especially with all the other options around town. looking at \"are these photos helpful\" none of the presentations for my rolls came close to those quality. in conclusion, yes i have experienced better., i feel bad leaving two stars for this place because my lunch partner recommended it, but i wasn\\'t impressed. \\n\\nthe restaurant was nearly empty at lunchtime on friday, which seemed odd. there was one server working and he was running around the whole time so we didn\\'t see him very often. we had to call out for water refills and flag him down for the check. \\n\\ni ordered a special roll with spicy tuna inside and torched salmon outside, plus a king crab roll. it\\'s pretty unlike me to not plow through my sushi, leaving no trace, but i actually didn\\'t even finish my rolls. they were fine, but not exceptional. my friend had a few of the larger special rolls and the pieces were cut so large she actually ended up choking on one -\\xa0thankfully, she was fine.  \\n\\nthe final nail in the coffin was when i went to wash my hands in the restroom and saw how filthy it was. i will not be returning, or ordering from this establishment, again., went there on a monday night for all you can eat sushi, $27+tip/tax which is a little expensive for the quality. first order the waitress forgot my order while everyone at my table had theirs. the sushi has toooooo much rice. i only order a few things but i was too full from all the rice.  the quality of sushi? uhh most sushi places in the city are okay, i love how everyone is like, this place has the best sushi place or the freshest fish... but seriously unless you are going to morimoto or zama, you probably aren\\'t getting the creme of the crop sushi. that being said, the items offered for the all you can eat is very limited. there weren\\'t many special rolls offered and if there were, there were far from special.\\n\\nthere was a 30-minute span of when our vase of water was empty. seeing how we had a group of 7 and all you can eat sushi/ soy sauce can make you thirsty, the waitress should at least knowledge to give us water. every other all you can eat sushi places have hastily refilled our water. when we asked to split the check for each person, the waitress looked all bitchy. well that\\'s what you get for shit service.\\n\\nso i ended spending $36 for awful sushi with too much rice... the rice wasn\\'t even good, some of it was not even cooked thoroughly. with $36 i could have a delicious  meal at yakitori along with some imported beer during happy hour or their specials., the restaurant decor is gorgeous and nicely done.  we ordered drinks....the bourbon mix was alright....the mint cucumber drink was all lime and vodka.where is the cucumber and lavender ?  a replacement was made and slightly improved but not edible.  their menu very limited...the meat balls were out of this world....we ordered the salmon a bit on the dry side and somewhat bland....the veal had two burnt spots and no taste no flavor. the veal was returned to the kitchen. we declined another entre as we lost our excitement for this restaurant .  we shared this with the manager who appeared uncomfortable, we did not see him sharing with the chefs or kitchen staff. the staffing was ample, our server was very very nice.  will we go again, no...not until we see a lot better reviews., c+ at best. lackluster menu and unprofessional disinterested  service. pricey for the quality and overall disappointing.  a restaurant lacking identity not knowing what it wants to be.  this restaurant will likely not be here next year., very disappointed in this restaurant ! it was very noisy because of the cafeteria style layout. i ordered the lobster polenta, salad and gnocchi. the lobster in the  polenta was chewy and had no flavor, the salad had no dressing on it and my gnocchi was very salty.  the portions were very small!! can\\'t believe they did not have salt and pepper shakers on the tables. the waiter asked if we were satisfied and i told him the food was not good. i was hopeful that he would take our criticism as not an insult, but to help them improve their business. our busboy, jack  was very young and he was more business like and very personable! thank you jack! \\nec, if it was up to me, i\\'d give this place a half a star.\\nthe food is terrible. very bland, no flavor, small portions and very overpriced for what they give you.\\nordered chicken entree and it was raw. ordered cappuccino and the milk was curdled.\\nthey brought over stale bread with one teaspoon of olive oil.  \\nthere are better choices to eat in doylestown, do not agree with previous level i found menus limited in choice of entrey s the meal was overpricred and not exceptional do noy zee how they will stay open, the service, decor, and atmosphere would get 6 stars if available ,, but the stuff they served us on their plates would be negative-3. so you get a star.\\ncan\\'t even call it food. burrata special,,, we were given a half, i repeat, a half sliced ball of burratta. who does that??? never in my life,, the whole thing is about cutting that in half and seeing the cream flow. oh,, the cream might have been 7-11 half n half. gross. so cheap. so lazy. chef should know better. we were giving the wrong pasta dish, started eating it anyway but was over powered w/ either liquid smoke or a giant piece of fire wood that fell into the pasta water. inedible. pizza. remember ellios, frozen microwave pizza??? they are better. \\ngo to spuntino and watch the guys make pizza with love. don\\'t understand how you let customers walk into your eatery ,, see a beautiful pizza oven and serve the most horrific pizza in my lifetime. i wouldn\\'t have given my dog the crust. ruined moms night out. thx to penn tap rooms yummy dessert for at least ending the night on a good note. place won\\'t last. blah. and wine list might have been chosen by someone who only drinks canned coors original. so dumb., would give it 1/2 a star. went there on a saturday night, got seated on time. this was probably the highlight of the evening. packed house and noisy ( high ceilings, no separation and feels like sitting in a train station). extremely slow service, only to find out that there seemed to be an issue with the kitchen (short staffed). the menu is very limited, especially when there are some of the items not available anymore, incl. some of the specials and that at main dinner time at 8:00 when we ordered our meals.9:30 and still no main course insight and waitress could not tell when food would arrive. no apologies or information, no manager in sight either. tables around us had same issue. in short, had to leave extremely disappointed. never to return.\\nfortunately there are many better choices in doylestown., was taken here for my birthday. i did not have to pay for it - but i thought it was way overpriced for what i was served. tiny portions - very limited selections - \"cold\" gray decor - no atmosphere - no views. nothing to recommend., if it was available, i would give this place a quarter of a star. the food is terrible. the portions are very small and the prices are very high for what they give you. i had to beg for salt and pepper to be provided at our table. when we got the stale bread with a half a teaspoon of olive oil i should\\'ve known it was a bad sign. did i mention the food was terrible... we ordered the lobster polenta which was bland as could be the salad was small and tasteless, i don\\'t even think it had any dressing on it. we ordered two pasta dishes that look more like side dishes then entrées. plus my pasta dish reminded me of my old franco american and chef boyardee days. when the waiter came over and asked us how everything was i told him i wasn\\'t very impressed and he said nothing. my advice is stay away from this place it\\'s going to be out of business in a couple of months, we finally decided to try vela again after canceling a couple times due to still being turned off by the previous experience. we are now doylestown locals again, and i\\'m sad to report that the service once again was not up to par. we went to the bar and had drinks to start. my wife enjoyed her cocktail, while mine fell flat. it was \"not that basic\", but tasted so. we ordered a couple appetizers at the bar, which were good. the bartenders were busy and overwhelmed and did not bring plates or silverware until after our order arrived. they did not clear them either. in fact, they were still sitting on the bar while i paid the bill. however, they did ask if we wanted refills for our cocktails, which we respectfully declined. we were a little turned off by the experience, and decided to go elsewhere for dinner. clearly, management is lacking here and/or proper training of the staff. after two tries, we won\\'t be returning. it\\'s a shame, the place is beautiful., my wife and i had a date night planned and were excited to visit vela for a nice dinner together. we enjoyed the food overall (chicken dish was good but maybe a bit of a small portion size) but unfortunately what upset us was in the service department... we had reservations for 5 pm and when we arrived we asked if we could be seated in a side table with a partial booth. we always prefer that as opposed to a tiny table out in the middle of the floor. the host told us sorry but no they couldn\\'t because it would be filling up very soon with people. we thought ok no problem but then they sat the very next couple after us in the booth table and then another after that. and by the time we were ready to leave at close to 6:30 there was hardly any other tables filled in the entire place... almost all of the booth tables remained open/empty. neither of us like to get too upset about stuff like this but it was just really annoying that they couldn\\'t just accommodate us initially and then the reasons they gave for it turned out to be horrible reasons. spoiled what was otherwise going to be a nice experience for us., great location, beautiful place, service was good but left hungry.  why? i\\'m gf and i reassured my meal was gf.  after i noticed my meal had couscous i had to send back for the first time.  i had to send back a second time after my fish was raw.  so disappointed, went to vela with friends for the first time last night. it was our first, and last time there. the menu was short, prices high and food terrible! unfortunately i left there hungry, as i could not even eat the dish i ordered. speaking to the manager was ineffective, as he did not seem to care at all. don\\'t waste your time or money here., horrible service. amateur hour.  waited 25 minutes without any contact whatsoever from anyone.  stay away, very underwhelming to say the least. based on the reviews i thought it was going to be great but i was really disappointed. the service was mediocre. anything we ordered took a long time to come out. the food wasn\\'t very good. my husband and i split the polenta and meatballs  and we didn\\'t finish either because they just tasted bad. the polenta was watery and an egg like consistency which was unpleasant. the entrees we had were either cold or to hot to eat. my meal was too hot to eat even after letting it cool for a couple minutes. my husbands was cold like it had been sitting out. super underwhelming especially for the area. i would not recommend this place., the restaurant is beautiful - our table was very nice as well.  we were a table of 12.    our waiter was great in the beginning but then didn\\'t deliver at all.  \\n\\n  we were very organized and ordered our wine, appetizers, and entrees with no issues at all.  \\n\\nhowever, our  appetizers came out at all different times....  dinner came out in 4 different times....  the last one to be delivered 20 minutes late and it was raw.....  very disappointing \\n\\nour bill was adjusted for the dinner that was late and a bottle of expensive  wine which wasn\\'t good at all... \\n\\nto top off the night - just a couple of hours later - my husband started to get really ill.   his food must have been raw too.   he still is in bed and it\\'s not because he had 2 glasses of wine - it was the fish.  \\n\\nwe will not be coming back again., i really want to like this restaurant, but it came up short on both visits.  my first visit, the special fish dish was nicely prepared and tasty, however my companion\\'s pappardelle pasta dish was pretty much tasteless and a small portion. second visit, pasta dishes tasted as if they were pre cooked and warmed up. the clam sauce was tasteless, the pasta mushy. the cacio e pepe bucatini was even worse. mushy tasteless pasta. very disappointing for an italian restaurant. they should re-evaluate the pasta dishes. however, a friends veal short ribs were very good and the meatball appetizer was average. very limited over priced for the value, wine list. would  i visit again? maybe, to try the pizza, because i really want to like this place. great atmosphere and parking in doylestown., the quality has reached an absolute low. can\\'t go here anymore. staff turnover and simple ignorance is running the place into the ground. dishes i once always enjoyed are now hit or miss. sorry, can\\'t do it any longer. i\\'m done, i\\'m sorry to say that i can\\'t give more than 2 stars. this used to be my favorite pizza shop in levittown, but after a serious price hike, ruse staff, and a lapse in the quality of their products, they have lost my patronage.\\n\\ntoday, i called them to order a medium pizza as a last ditch effort to hopefully keep ordering there, only to be hung up on twice by a rude fellow who could barely speak english., if i could give no stars parkway would get no stars  every time we order from this dump they get the order wrong (onions when told no onions; tomatoes when told no tomatoes; no mayo and mayo is on the item) ! tonight we ordered 3 strombolis (pepperoni in 1) plain with cheese in 1 small and 1 large  the order taker didn\\'t know what we were talking about saying \"we have never had that ordered like that before\" we said cheese only the order is delivered and i didn\\'t look at the receipt (big mistake) and they sent 2 small strombolis (correct) and a calzone with ham and ricotta (not what we ordered).how difficult is it to get the order right? we will never order/eat from this dump again. suggest you go somewhere else unless you enjoy the wrong order., third time there and definitely the last. each time gets progressively worse.  stopped in for the lunch time special. two slices and a soda 4.25.  pizza was over cooked and tasteless.  like chewing cardboard .  i guess there is an art to making good pizza and they have not come close to mastering it., had the bacon cheeseburger pizza, which i heard was their best pie.  huge mistake.  the pie was so slathered with cheez whiz that it was impossible to taste anything else on the pie.  i think it would have been better with shredded cheddar cheese mixed with the mozz, but that\\'s my opinion.\\n\\ni have had their plain pie, which is ok (the sauce is pretty good), but pretty standard pizzeria stuff., ordered online, food delivered with wrong order and stale bread. delivery was fast but not worth it to order again from here. plenty of other pizza places in the area to order from, nothing special about pizza that\\'s like cardboard with sauce and cheese smeared all over it .just another levittown pizza dive, lousy service! called and ordered 3 items, one of the 3 being a salad. it took over an hour to arrive, food came cold, and items were wrong. i called and they said i could send back the food and they would send me out a new order. i waited an hour for the first order, not waiting another hour when my child was hungry for dinner., big pizza fans and since this was close to\\nhome we figured it would be worth a shot! i\\'d consider this comparable to little caesars pizza. thin tasteless crust, stingy with the sauce, and cheese. i might be good if there was actually pizza on the pizza. the whole thing is just skimpy. if you\\'re in a pinch and hungry try it. but we will go elsewhere., yikes. this place is a mess. it\\'s very small and has two rows of fast-food-style booths crammed very close together. surrounding everything is clutter and junk. let me list some of the things i saw:\\na suitcase\\na weed wacker\\na plastic christmas tree\\npatio furniture \\na rice cooker under a seat\\na model ship\\na flashlight\\na large, empty cardboard box\\nfake plants\\nreal plants\\nmany religious figurines and icons.\\n\\nwhen we tried to order, the waitress excused herself to see if they had what we ordered. they were out of beef. it was lunchtime on a saturday. we then ordered chicken and sugar pork, which, after checking with the chef again, our waitress confirmed they could make. she then left the restaurant for a few minutes and returned with a bottle of water for one of us who had ordered water and a package with a picture of fried bananas on it. \\n\\nthe pork was good. the chicken was three fried drumsticks served next to rice. egg rolls and fried bananas were average. fried bananas could really use a sauce besides the sweet and sour sauce served with the egg rolls. \\n\\nthe people were nice. i don\\'t know how this place stays open. cramped, cluttered, and average food., upon walking into this place i wasn\\'t sure if i was in a restaurant or a thrift store there was so much junk laying around every where like a suitcase, a pair of shoes. my first thought was to get the hell out of this place as soon as possible but my wife insisted so we stayed and everything taste like it was cooked with pork and not good pork., i\\'ve been to this place several times just to buy filipino dinguhuan because there\\'s no other place that sells that dish. i have tried other foods here before but they weren\\'t that great. the food was bland. the next problem about this place is the fact that they are never open. they only open saturday and sunday\\'s and that\\'s very inconvenient because who wants to go here on a weekend. the interior of this place is terrible because there\\'s so much stuff in there all cluttered and no place to move around. it feels like someone\\'s house in this restaurant which is awkward., it\\'s so hard to make filipino food \\'great again\\'? disappointing that all dishes are pork based at lunch time. two girls helping each other. the store is full of things that makes this semi restaurant unappealing, unappetizing. i was excited to try, then sad that i participated in belonging to eat filipino food. i felt i have been \\'trump\\' once again in an illusion that all filipino food store will make me satisfied., no orders over the phone? what\\'s so hard about taking my order and preparing food for a pick-up? good luck in this pick up and delivery dominated food industry., i come to reading terminal a few times a week so i\\'ve tried most of the food here. i got the chicken pinchos which were covered in a lot of bbq sauce and contained no rice, vegetables etc. just chicken on a stick and a small piece of bread. i love tostones but mine were a little dry and did not taste fresh. the food wasnt terrible but definitely wasnt worth the $14., over priced!!! i paid $17 to support and in return received mushy yellow rice, beans that taste like they came right out the can a few chopped up pieces of dried out fried chicken top with two miniature empanadas (puerto ricans eat pastellilos)...never again, save your money!!!! so disappointing, empanadillas are a joke! $3.24 for a tiny little thing that honestly should be worth 50 cents., absolutely terrible! i paid $14 for 2 empanadas and tostones. the empanadas were the size of my ring finger and extremely oily. the tostones, i understand are fried, but were extremely dry, bland and hard as a rock! i would never recommend this place to anyone., i went in on a sunday morning to pick up a few desserts for a family gathering at the center city location..  i saw baklava, and was told not to purchase them by the sales associate (and i appreciate her honesty) because they were hard as a rock..  i then purchased to cakes, a pound cake, and a peanut butter mousse cake.  everyone was looking forward to the peanut butter cake.  everyone took a bite and spit it out!  it was stale.  the chocolate was ok, but the mousse has a horrible rank taste, and smell as well.  it tasted and smelled  like spoiled cream cheese.  it wasn\\'t one of those things that taste like something, it was spoiled.  even the partial peanut butter cups on the top tasted stale!!!\\n\\nthe pound cake was ok, nothing special..  needless to say, the experience of tasting spoiled food makes me never to return again!, so many things wrong with my cake order for my 4 year old\\'s birthday. 1) the cake was not decorated colorfully eventhough i specifically requested. it\\'s a kiddy birthday, you\\'d figure the decorator could at least put in an effort. the cake was a very dull dark brown icing with equally dull 1 strip of orange icing around the sides. i was guaranteed it would be beautiful and i had to take it home and perform some diy to make it pretty. 2) the cake was uneven on the surface, probably it has been sitting outside for too long. part of the icing on the top had began to slide down. \\nnow let\\'s move on to customer service. no one at the shop was helpful, they simply shrugged when asked questions. they knew the cake looked horrible and said they couldn\\'t do anything because their cake decorator was not around. i feel this place has no work ethics and don\\'t care about their customers. they\\'re in the cake business, supposed to be making people happy for their special day. not making this mistake again., i was so excited to see that popito\\'s opened up in center city!  my friend brought a selection of cookies to a recent party, which were delicious so when i stumbled upon their second location at 13th & walnut i purchased a lovely assortment of desserts to bring home and enjoy with my husband.  what a disappointment!!  the chocolate cupcake was without a doubt, a day old, and dry and stale.  i want my $6 back for that old cupcake which never should have been sold.  the cookies were a mixture of old and fresh.  i want to know when it became ok to sell customers old baked goods and bake every other day instead of daily?  the pecan pie had an awful taste, which i couldn\\'t seem to place, but was simply unpalatable, so into the trash that went immediately.  i spent a total of $27 and only got a few fresh cookies for my money.   even the classic italian pine-nut cookies were too sugary and sweet and stale.  no one should change classic recipes, and everyone should bake daily.\\n\\ni\\'m personally insulted that these owners think so little of me, their customer, to sell me stale goods.\\n\\nmy suggestion -- stay away from popito\\'s completely, and instead buy baked goods from a purveyor with a good reputation for making fresh baked goods daily., attention all brides this place is a disgrace. my aunt paid for her wedding cake in full weeks prior to her wedding.the wedding was this past saturday and it couldn\\'t have been more perfect until the wedding cake failed to show up ! the manger at the venue called the bakery multiple times and even had the manger of the bakery\\'s personal number and everyone failed to answer a phone call!!!!! the manger at venue even drove to the horrible bakery and it was closed !!!!! my aunt left for her honeymoon for two weeks so my cousin had went to the shitty bakery to retrieve the money and the manger lied to her only gave some of the money back. once my cousin got in touch with the bride and found out the real price of the cake she had to call the bakery once again to get the rest of the money back !!!!! absolute disgrace!!!!, i purchased a birthday cake and other assorted cakes and cookies. after the festivities or the next day i contacted this place.they were rude snooty and very unprofessional. it is not that i lost my money or served stale goods to family and friends i lost a really good bakery. they were really good at one time and now they are not!!\", i wish i could give \"no stars\". i ordered a chocolate cake with chocolate butter cream icing for my daughter\\'s first holy communion luncheon this past saturday.  the cake was suppose to be delivered by 11:00 am and when we arrived at the restaurant at 11:35 the cake was still not delivered.  i called the bakery and at first they could not find the order.  the woman on the phone was trying to help but when i asked to talk to the owner (who was in the background shouting answers to the woman helping me on the phone), she said no because she was helping a person there for a cake testing.  apparently once you pay 100% for your order you are not as much of a priority as someone who\\'s business they are still trying to get.  after a few minutes i was told that they found the order and it would be right over.   at 12:10 (an hour and 10 minutes past delivery time) the cake and cupcakes arrived and they were disgraceful.  the cake did not have the design that i had ordered (a cross made out of icing flowers and a rosary...something they suggested)  the writing on the cake was crooked and looked like it had been done honestly like a 5 year old had done it and the final touch a pair of rosary beads were just thrown on the cake.  they should be ashamed of what they sent.  they took a cake and quickly tried to fill my order.  when i called back (right away...again taking time away from my daughter, friends and family), the owner was still was with the cake tester and would still not get on the phone.  she called a few minutes later and was very matter of fact that they did not lose the order.  i told her i could not deal with this now as i had already spent 1/2 hour of my daughter\\'s party on the phone.  she told me she would call me in 2 days.  that was 6 days ago.  btw i still have chocolate cake left over.  it was so overly sweet and not the butter-cream icing that i ordered that no one even wanted leftovers.  we live in the area and had been customers of potito\\'s for years.  never again.  overrated and terrible management.  a photo of the cake is my profile pic., i\\'ve only had doughnuts here and honestly, i wasn\\'t that impressed. they were rather hard and the icing cracked and fell off in huge chunks when i took a bite. the filling on the inside was not very creamy, more like a thick version of cake icing. \\n\\ni\\'d stop in and try a cannoli if in the area, but i won\\'t be going out of my way to do so., ordered my daughter\\'s6th birthday cake in advance and paid cash -- $70-- when we went to pick it up shop was closed.  no sign on the door, no phone call - nothing.  neighbors told is they closed in middle of night for no reason.  my daughter cried on the way to her birthday party.  they reopened several months later and i tried to get my $70 back -- they wouldn\\'t even talk to me.\\n\\nfor my daughter, isgros was kind enough to make her little mermaid cake in 15 minutes., for the 2012 holidays i  ordered a large tin of italian cookies and 1 order of the non-peril bars. unable to bake last year due to surgery, i felt the cookies would be a nice treat for my family as well as for my meals on wheels clients that i delivered to every day. \\nhow disappointing when i did not receive the entire order. the non peril bars never came. in addition, the cookies in the tin were very poorly  packed. for the price they charge for packaging, the cookies were a mess. broken, smushed, no layering in between. every cookie tasted like amaretto because there was no division between them. i called five times and wrote two letters with all of the documentation enclosed, asking for a refund for the cookies i never received. still waiting. at one point, someone from potitos did call and acknowledge the error, promising me a refund as well as promising to send me a few cookies as a coutesy for my troubles.still waiting for that as well. \\nall i wanted was a refund for cookies i never received. their cookies may be good in the store, but don\\'t order online.you will end up paying for something you never get. and be treated very poorly., i have bought cookies there several times in the past and found mole on them. i will never shop there again., i hate to base a review on one product but...\\nthe place smells amazing and the stuff in the window looked great. i got a cinnamon bun filled w/ cream and covered in chocolate. yuck! the cake was dry (stale), the cream filling was not buttercream, the chocolate frosting was poor commercial quality (all i could taste was sugar) and the whole thing was overly sweet. i barely got thru half of it.\\ni\\'m hoping their italian pastries would fare better, but am kind of hesitant after the monstrosity i got that i did not enjoy at all., they used to be good.  things have changed...\\n\\neither they\\'ve hired cheap help or changed their recipes to incorporate shortcuts, which drives up costs and decreases quality.\\n\\ni live close by and would wake up to the amazing smells that come out of that place.  not anymore..., our wedding venue uses them for the wedding cake. they were awful. the cake didn\\'t look professionally made. did not taste good, was ordinary with too sweet sugar icing. and was so tiny ! we had a beautiful wedding but the cake was a real disappointment.  asked for a partial refund and there was no argument (i\\'m sure they get this all the time) but every time i call i\\'m told it\\'s in the mail.  don\\'t use this bakery., i wanted to try something new so i went inside this small cute little bakery located on walnut. this was my first time here and it will definitely be my last. the service was worth 2 stars to start. most of the girls were on there phones texting. second, i wanted about three items on the menu and one of the girls just kept telling me they were out of the ingredients. i don\\'t know if it is store policy for the girls to wear glove when handling bread, but she wasn\\'t wearing gloves when she made my sandwich. i settled for a sandwich; and when it was received, there was a black thing this size of a thumb tack in it.. and there was only one in the bread and not the rest of it. i won\\'t be back., i would give zero stars if possible. first, the attitude of the staff was rude and unacceptable. i felt as if i was inconveniencing them for being there to pick up my order. second, they did not fulfill my order correctly. i placed an order a week prior for multiple pounds of cookies and explicitly stated which types of cookies i would like placed in the order. they completely ignored that request and only gave me a few types. people have been saying this business has been going downhill, and unfortunately it is true. the quality of the desserts is decent, but the service is absolutely horrible. i sadly will not be returning., never again. i got a cupcake cake that looked pathetic. it was nothing like what the picture i showed. it\\'s ok if you can\\'t do it but let people know so they can go some where else. i was charged like $80 for that disgrace. i also purchase two donuts that were stale as hell. what a complete joke and embarrassing., let me start off by saying that prior to today, i was a huge fan of potito\\'s bakery.  my favorite is their italian cream cake or rum cake as others have called it.  i picked up one today for my birthday.\\nwhen we cut the cake, it wasn\\'t as high as i remember their cakes being.  the cake was dry and there wasn\\'t a hint of rum in the cake!  i was very, very disappointed.  \\ni send everyone i know to potito\\'s for cakes and cannoli\\'s but after today and some other things i\\'ve heard from neighbors about the quality, i don\\'t\\' know if i\\'ll be going back or referring them to anyone anymore.\\nvery disappointed in the quality of this cake.  this is the first time, ever, that i\\'ve been disappointed with anything from them.\\nwith that said, the cake looked very pretty!, i am giving one star because i have to.  i ordered a large cake and paid $70 in cash.  when i went to pick it up, the bakery was closed with no additional information.  they re-opened months later but would never refund my money.  not a good business model., i have always ordered our family cake \"italian cream (rum) cake from this location except for the short period time that they were closed. this is the second time that i have been discussed and it will be the last!  \\nthis time we ordered a half of sheet cake italian cream which is an expensive cake. i go to pick it up and the ladies whom are very nice can not locate it. of course my stomach is in a knot this cake is for my nephew\\'s 1st holy communion party that begins in an hr. here is a very long story short... whom ever took my order wrote the wrong day of the week on paper with correct date. everyone in the bakery is telling me its not there fault. honestly i don\\'t care who\\'s fault it is i just need a solution. luckily the baker was still in and i was able to get a cake within 45 minutes being now 45 minutes late to the party. when i asked for a discount i was abruptly told (by the baker) that i was already given a 10% discount. yes, that is true due to the fact that my children attend the performing arts. however, that is what i\\'m entitled to.  this is a total different thing that is happening i don\\'t have a cake! after 45 minutes i did receive a  beautiful cake. however, when eating the cake i noticed that there was no rum!  hence that this is an italian rum cake this was a total disappointment. i did receive an addition 10% off from the very nice and concerned counter girls and i am grateful that the baker was still in. but in the moment it was terrible and very unsettling. unfortunately, this was defiantly icing on the cake for our family. we will no longer be ordering cakes from this bakery., they were the best in town at one time. not anymore. they need to stop expanding and go back to original times. the cannolis didn\\'t have any flavor at all. the lobster tail was stale and chewy.  they over bake for all their shops and still sell the old stale pastry.  very disappointing.  i remember when it was one shop and all the pastry was fresh. this is what happens when the kids take over the family business., don\\'t have an  ubereats store you don\\'t attend. canceled orders and wasted time on more than one occasion., terrible ! such a rip off !!!! i paid alittle over $550 for my baby shower cake and it was awful !!!! the design was nothing of what i asked for ! they completely did what they wanted to do ! they obviously cannot do fondant cakes like they said they can !, my family was very disappointed in the italian cream cake. the cake was falling apart as we were cutting it and the icing was hard as a rock. this isn\\'t the first time that this has happened. quality seems to have changed over the past couple years., this bakery has gone way downhill. i placed an order and showed them what i wanted and they said we can do that. what they gave me looked nothing like i wanted. i called and ask to speak to a manager and was told she would call me the next day which she did not. i will never go to this bakery ever again., ordered for pick up and was told 45 minutes. arrived 45 minutes after ordering and waited another 45 minutes for cold food. never again. i\\'ll never pay 40$ for an hour and a half wait for cold food. i\\'ll go to the place on the next corner and get my food faster and hotter., this will be short and sweet.  the pizza was good.  the stromboli had pepperoni in it, which i did not order and subsequently did not eat.  the hubs said it was good.  delivery legitimately took 2 hours.  2 hours!  no, it wasn\\'t worth it., i have been putting off ordering from here for a couple years.  i decided to try it tonight...the girl that took my order was borderline rude and delivery took an hour and 10 minutes though they told me it\\'d be 30 min.  \\n  i got it and the food is cold.  the chicken cheesesteak is not impressive (could be because i prefer shredded chicken, theirs is chunks) it could also be because it\\'s not hot... pizza would be ok if it was hot, it\\'s not great at room temperature and the poppers are cold which renders them basically inedible :-/\\n  i did call to let them know.  i\\'m not looking for anything free or discounted but believe they should know when something is this bad.  the manager was nice (i was nice as well), and he offered to remake the food.  i politely declined as it is 10 pm which is really already too late to be eating dinner, he then told me he\\'d note my address and the next time i order they\\'d give me a \"hefty\" discount.  \\n\\n  i don\\'t think i\\'m going to order again to take them up on that discount., $3 for peperoni topping,  a  large...$16 total !  wow, wear a mask next time your robb people,  place is dumpy for such high prices, sauce had no flavor, -don\\'t ask for basil because they won\\'t stick it on the pizza\\n-strombolis have been undercooked on the inside its disgusting\\n-if you ask without parm they\\'ll stick parm on it. \\n-every time we have ordered we have only gotten half of our order. we would call back, they would say they are sending someone. an hour and half later we would have to call back and they say they didn\\'t know instead of taking it off the bill. \\ngood prices but we won\\'t be ordering from there anymore. i guess you get what you pay for., do yourself a favor and order from pizza hut or a chain that delivers within 30 minutes.  ordered a pizza, nothing else, and it took over an hour.  last time!, it arrived late and cold!\\nso soggy i could barely get it out the box and hold it without it falling apart and the fries were way overcooked.\\nkind of ruined my whole night.\\n\\nmy dad enjoyed his cheeseburger though., this place is advertised for open 24/7 and we called and they were closed . if you\\'re going to advertise open 24/7 at least up date your info, my sister ordered from here on a coworker\\'s recommendation for a special lunch for us (because we\\'re visiting from out of state). they had quoted her a delivery time of approximately 45 minutes. it was a full hour and 45 minutes before they arrived. when they did get there, the pizza was flat, lukewarm, and greasy. it would have been more worth my time just to bring my own lunch, or to go out for lunch (though based on the quality of the pizza, probably still not here). if you\\'re going to lollygag on delivery, at least show up with a hot pizza or an amazing crust or something. not recommended, not worth it., i guess it\\'s under new management.stopped in last night to pick up a order. only to see the owner arguing with an elderly couple about a gift card from previous owner. my order was delayed fifteen minutes or so due to the problem. finally couple was taken care of. not sure if i will go back, longtime customer. it looks like a buy and flip of business. hope not., is it just me? but has johnny\\'s jumped the shark? got my pickup order wrong, no big deal. the pizza is not the same. i know it\\'s tough times but to me the pizza is disappointing, waited 2 hours pizza is dry. not first time either. over billed for pizzas, so drive back to in counter the nastiest rudest girl at front. \\nthis place does not deserve the customers they have, im a big fan of johnnys - i understand the craziness going on right now but i ordered at 7:30pm on grubhub which is normally great and at 9:15 i called for a status update and they told me \"oh our grubhub printer isn\\'t working we aren\\'t doing those tonight.\" ... so after waiting an hour and a half we find this out ... i just feel like as an establishment you need to know to turn off your grubhub status when the printer doesn\\'t work (which is an option) total ball drop by the place. you have to better than that. 3-5 day wait for a refund now and 4 hungry people. just upsetting from a place i really like., this is one of the greatest pizza places in delaware county, however their delivery times are awful. they will tell you 30 minutes, and your pizza won\\'t be there for over an hour. they show no remorse for it., food was 2 hours late !  \\n\\nwe placed the order online at 6:45 ,  was told it would be here by 7:30-7:45.  when i hit 8pm i called and before i could even ask my question the girl on the phone cut me off and just said \" it left\".  it takes about 15 minutes tops from my house to them, we didn\\'t get out food til about 8:30-8:40.  never again., they are terrible at delivery.  they forgot part of our order, a cheesesteak.  there was no buffalo sauce with the buffalo salad, no marinara on the italian sausage and peppers sandwich, no marinara sent with the mozzarella sticks, no tartar sauce with flounder sandwich.  the appetizers were barely warm., i ordered a large cheese pizza, half bacon n beef and an order of broccoli bites. it was delivered ice cold! both the pie and the bites. i called them to let them know since i\\'m a regular customer and thought they would want to know. well, the guy argued with me that it was impossible because we are just 4 minutes away. why would i call?? was he calling me a liar??? i didn\\'t want my money back or a new order, just giving feedback. well now i\\'ll never order from there again. what a shame because i enjoyed their pizza but not ice cold. it was like the air conditioner was blowing right on it. the man was rude, and didn\\'t want to hear anything i had to say. well now i say i will never order from them again!!!, one star because i can\\'t put a half star, food quality is garbage, my wrap fell apart, not to mention it wasn\\'t what i ordered....will never be back stay away, ordered a large pie half white half plain on a saturday afternoon. delivery was fast and prices are good, but the pizza wasn\\'t great. felt it could have been cooked a little longer and it was very greasy., food is great most of the time. every time we order the food takes longer and longer to arrive. today we called for pizza and fries. after an hour i call to see if the order went out. rude man answered and said yes it went out with 10 other orders. realy????? after an hour and a half the food finally arrives, yep your got it, cold. the pizza looks like it was sitting around since yesterday. never going to order from them again.... oooo and last time i have the driver $10 tip., the slowest delivery that has existed. i\\'ve given you guys 3 shots. you\\'re .6 miles away me, it shouldnt take a hour and a half to deliver food on a week night. italianna\\'s, oscars, new london, america\\'s pie and even dominoes deliver within the estimated time or faster. your counter staff/delivery guys could give a shit. your pizza is ok, middle of the road, nothing to write home about., if you\\'re going to advertise yourself as a pre- and post- basketball game venue, maybe actually be prepared for those crowds. went there on a saturday. half our party ate 45 minutes before the rest of us because the kitchen was backed up. they had too few wait staff available. our waitress was running around like a chicken with her head cut off. we couldn\\'t have as many drinks as we would have preferred. and, even though my food arrived long after some of the rest of our party, it was somehow cold. and the food wasn\\'t so good. wouldn\\'t recommend., i was in the neighborhood and remembered that i\\'d read good things about the brunch menu in the school newspaper. i wasn\\'t quite in time for brunch, but i decided to try the regular menu anyways. overall, i was not impressed. thoughts below:\\n\\nservice: mediocre. i was left at the front of the restaurant for far too long, waiting for someone to come and seat me. it wasn\\'t that they were full--i could see empty tables--but nobody was at the desk. eventually the bartender had to come out and sit me down. i also ran into issues when i asked about wifi; all the waiters insisted that there was in fact a network, but none of them could agree on the wpa password, and none of the options they gave me worked. on the plus side, they took my order, delivered my food, and gave me my check in a reasonable time span.\\n\\nappetizer: i tried the honey barbecue wings. the sauce was thin and wet, dripping off the wings almost like water. the sour cream didn\\'t stick well to the wings because of this. the wings were also somewhat bland. there was a little taste in the sauce, but on the whole the wings were not as flavorful as those in other venues in the city.\\n\\nmain: i got the chicken parmesan. this was again very bland, and the chicken additionally was rather tough. it came on a bed of tasteless linguini.\\n\\nvalue: the wings were $9, which is about standard for wings in the city. the chicken parmesan was $13, also about normal for a casual pub entree. but the food was below par, so i don\\'t think it was worth it.\\n\\nwill i return: i still do want to try the brunch, which might be better than the regular menu. otherwise, though, i don\\'t intend to return. if you\\'re in the neighborhood and you want a good irish pub, head two blocks north and go to the far-superior slainte., poorly managed, slow service. they ask you to come before the game, but don\\'t have the staff to accommodate you. okay food., my husband and i decided to finally try picca\\'s on a thursday night. we arrived around 7pm. we were told there was a 15-20 minute wait. however there were tons of tables open, but okay. i have a background in the biz so i understand sometimes there may be things behind the scenes like short staffed or doubling seating servers, etc. we waited 15 minutes and were sat. the ambience in this place reminds me of the inside of a pizza hut sit down restaurant when they used to have the buffets. not too impressed. the menu also reminds me of a chain-like italian wannabe. nothing special or innovative. yawn. our server was friendly and took our drink order. she dropped the drinks off and said she would be right with us. we drank our drinks and waited...\\nand waited...\\nand waited...\\nno sign of her! i looked at my watch. it was going on 8pm. \\n35 minutes and she never came to take our order. we left some cash for the drinks and headed to another restaurant...one we felt confident would be a better experience. \\ncan\\'t tell you how the food was, but it is safe to say we will never go back., overpriced, slow service even though it wasn\\'t busy when we arrived. eggplant parm was excellent as was the cannoli. one person in our party is vegan.  there was almost nothing on the menu for vegans. generally heard that the other location was legendary.  this was not a great experience, im an upper darby native so my review might be biased, im sorry but the menu at this picas, does not hold a candle to the menu at the upper darby location. the west chester picas menu is significantly smaller than the upper darby menu. the west chester location doesnt have half the options \\n\\nadditionally, i ordered the fettucini alfredo --- it comes out, and half the plate is an alfredo sauce lake. it was terribly salty and not edible because they really overdid it with the sauce. and now i feel bad because i just made my boyfriend blow 60 $ for this mediocre food \\n\\nif you want the real picas experience, make the trek to the upper darby location. ill never dine here again - first time, last time., bad food high prices.  ordered the stromboli. got a sandwich with grease dripping off it.  didn\\'t even take a bite.  threw it out when i got home.   save your money and pass on this place, this restaurant needs to figure out how to handle the crowd interested in all the hype. saturday night was a mob scene. we were told an hour without a reservation. since this is a pizza place that seems kind of crazy but since we had small kids we decided to wait. 1 and 1/2 hours later we still weren\\'t seated. it took close to two hours to get a seat while many tables sat empty. once seated our service was not good. apps were wrong and service was very slow. food is interesting and pretty good but not worth the wait. i recommend waiting until they figure out how to handle this business.\\nvery disappointing overall experience!!, very disappointed !!  i grew up near the pica\\'s in delco. we went there often. anxious about this opening only to be let down.  \\n$15.00 antipasta was a huge let down. meats were all cold cuts......no real aged provolone and no prosciutto!!  no comparison to giuseppe\\'s in edgemont. they are the real deal..\\nwe ordered penne with tomato gravy. sauce was watery and flavorless. tasted like they opened a can!!  minestrone soup was just ok. lastly their  famous pizza was bland at best. nothing special at all. again tomato gravy was bland. no garlic,no italian herbs,etc. \\nsorry to say i probably will not go back, bland pizza with bland toppings.  sort of like a tomato pie, but without the flavor.\\n\\nafter all the hype of having a pica nearby, i was really let down.  not sure why people rave about this., if you order takeout...double the pick up time and you should not have a problem.  i\\'ll never go back as long as las vegas pizza is open. they say 10 minutes they mean 10 minutes.  pica should have stayed in delaware county., no italian hoagies!  picas is known for their pizza and italian hoagies. i\\'ll pass. plus who laid out this parking lot. i thought upper darby\\'s was bad. they went down hill since mrs. law left., i received a gift card, in october, that was purchased in upper darby.  i was told after i received my $95 tab they wouldn\\'t honor the $50 gift card because of different pos.  i asked if they could switch over the existing gift card to theirs and they said no.  unfortunately, for the waitress she had to get a lower tip because of this poor customer service.  food was good, but i will not give them any business in the future., unlike the upper darby location, the west chester location does not offer a lunch menu.  $15 for a sandwich, fries and tea?  with tax, tip and/or ordering one of the more expensive sandwiches can easily run $20 tab ... for lunch!!  and why does tea cost more than soda or coffee?\\n\\nno thank you. i might be back for dinner but not lunch., the first thing that caught  my attention  was the very sterile decorating.  it is odd and not very inviting.  the service is distant. i found the menu full of the usual fare. my wife noted the beer list is lacking in better beer. if you like mass produced swill, you will be happy. our entrees came quickly enough. i found mine to be bland and lacking any real flavor. i was disappointed. my wife\\'s commented that her dinner was lacking in flavor too. i would say our meals were meh at best. the value for the money spent was poor. i have had better italian fare at a strip mall pizza shop. i know we could have received a better value too., this is very disorganized and cannot handle the crowd. they continuously have a 45-50 min wait and stop taking reservations early in the day. numerous table are empty while you wait 45 mins. get your act together, this place had so much hype...and i was terribly disappointed. we\\'ve been 3 times just to see if it was maybe sucking due to opening kinks. nope. awful each time. the calamari was covered in olives which was not indicated anywhere on the menu. needless to say i hate olives...like don\\'t taint my food dude! the pizza was a soggy disaster. i\\'m only giving the second star bc the place serves alcohol. maybe...just maybe after a few drinks the food becomes edible?, hostess & service staff very polite. my seafood alfredo was excellent. my wife\\'s chicken parm was sub par, was chicken fingers with marinara sauce on top. very disappointing. i ask for a beer on tap and the service staff said they were probably out, i stated my second choice and they came back with a bottle. very disappointing. i was informed that she wished they would get rid of the beer on tap menu. me too. they didn\\'t have over half on the menu. i will hesitate before coming back here again., i would give this a 0 if i could. an absolute disgrace to pizza. first of all the dough was frozen. second of all, when the cheese is under the sauce and you can\\'t tell if there\\'s even cheese on the pizza- it\\'s not enough cheese. zero flavor. it was over priced garbage. we\\'re throwing it out. don\\'t waste your time or money., i this is not my 1st time at picas but it seems to be getting worse. very small portions for the money. it seems like the portions are getting smaller. olive garden has bigger portions. the service stunk too they need better servers. i don\\'t think i\\'ll be going back there again, i\\'ve been going to picas since i moved to the area is 2005 as my husband loves the pizza. after tonight\\'s dinner, unfortunately i\\'m not sure we will be going back. the bread seemed as if someone gutted it and then served it - it was basically crust and the pizza (half pepperoni, half meatball) was extremely disappointing. the pizza was slightly burned on the bottom yet came out luke warm and had little to no flavor. they have sprinkle garlic on the table which had the same size holes as crushed red pepper so when you pour it on the pizza be careful or you\\'ll have a pile of garlic. at 7:15 we felt rushed to leave the restaurant despite them closing at 9pm. really disappointing picas experience., couldn\\'t wait for this place to open as i was raised in upper darby, pa. first visit was ok shortly after it opened the restaurant is lovely inside no out.  a couple of weeks later when i ordered a large pizza to go with extra cheese they said 20 minutes.  i arrived in 18 minutes and the pizza box was not hot on the bottom.  stupid me thought the box is vey heavy.  when i got to my car i put my finger into the pizza and it was barely warm.  the pizza was probably sitting and cheese was just added on the top.  no i didn\\'t go in and complain i will never ever return this place is too expensive for this to,happen.  i don\\'t recommend this location., updating my review. after coming here again last night because the food was so great last time we were all disappointed. service was still excellent but everything food wise was just not. pizza was soggy. not enough cheese. salads were made differently than before. just a mediocre experience last night, ordered take out from picas tonight. i ordered 3 small pizzas and fries and the bill was close to $50. picked up within the 15 minutes we were told and after less than 2 minute drive home the pizzas were ice cold! it areas such as disappointment., my non-review: before pica\\'s west opened, i heard the owner saying something like \" we decided to open this location near west chester because many of our \"customers\" moved out that way\".  translation? upper darby is going to down hill fast.  i ate at the ud location in the 70\\'s and never went back.....  inverted pizza isn\\'t for me., horrible. we were so excited to go. as we have been hearing about it since we moved here. my son and i ordered steaks.  two filets they were served about 20 minutes after everyone else in our party was served and done. worst part the steaks were overcooked. \\n\\nwe would never go back., really easy to explain\\n\\nmozzarella sticks - $11.00!! breaded fried cheese right???\\ncheeseburger -$13.00 who pays that??\\ncaeser salad -$14.00 - romaine lettuce???\\n\\nordered a pizza and left., downgrade.\\npizza is as expected albeit cold upon arrival.\\ngarlic bread rocks. \\nbaked ziti third strike. in the voice of clara in the burger commercial where\\'s the ricotta cheese? warm. mozzarella and macaroni. that\\'s it. the first time was spectacular. struck out. never again. \\nthese are tough times. i\\'m cool on temperature of pizza. that slop of rigatoni is nothing like your first shipment. that was amazing. i\\'m angry it\\'s gone. still a happy customer., our server was great and the food was okay, but unfortunately was very turned off by an encounter with a  rude manager., i just had horrible fried shrimp here. the shrimp had no sweetness whatsoever and the texture was strange but that is because it was not actually shrimp - it was fried prawns. come on people, ya can\\'t call it shrimp when it\\'s not shrimp. crawfish is not mini lobster and prawns are not shrimp!!!!!\\n\\ni didn\\'t dig the spaghetti that came along with either as the sauce was not very good. \\n\\ni\\'m done with this place., must be a full moon, everything was confusing from the beginning, bread was frozen and the staff was unconscious\\nseating in the isle while the restaurant was empty. after saying that i would pay for the drinks and the wait staff gave me the bill,then the manager came to talk to us she then said she would take care of the drinks.i can\\'t say i will go back anytime soon.its all about the manager who hired the bottom of the barrel, nothing like picking up some takeout only to have to cook it when you get it home. their hours have become seldom \"because of covid\" as well. tried to patronize this restaurant 10-15 times in the last year and couldn\\'t because they were closed every. single. time. when we finally got the chance to grab takeout, it was sadly undercooked., first time eating at pica\\'s west chester after years of enjoying upper darby picas.   service was very slow.  booth was cold, food so so, and no cheese steaks on the menus., dined for lunch on friday 3/3/17. very disappointed.  arrived at 1:15 and the dining room and bar area was half filled.  several people were waiting in the lobby to be seated.  registered at the desk and was told there was a 10 minute wait or could self seat at the bar.  seemed like they didn\\'t have enough staff working to accommodate customers.  after 15 minutes, we were seated and greeted by a very welcoming server.  lots of empty tables but lack of servers - really on a friday?\\n     roasted peppers were served with a warm delicious italian round loaf and butter.  the peppers were warm and delicious and the bread crusty and soft on the inside.  lunch was served timely. \\n     the chicken alfredo ($18) was less than expected.  the fettuccine was substituted for angel hair pasta as requested but the entire contents were \"floating\" in the alfredo sauce.  it looked more like a bowl of soup and tasted like a can of alfredo poured over the pasta and chicken not a homemade sauce.  the chicken parm sandwich  was like a \"grinder\" ($10) and was a generous size and included a side of coated french fries.the red sauce was delicious. soda\\'s are $2.50 with free refills.\\n     other customers were eating pizza which was a flat bread pizza served on cookie sheets.\\nthis restaurant is known for it\\'s pizza but the menu is not the same as the delco restaurant. i would recommend the chicken parm sandwich but stay away from the alfredo dishes. they also offer a kids menu. will not return., all excited about picas opening in west chester since i\\'m originally from delco. so the first two weeks couldn\\'t get a pizza. finally was able to get in and the food was horrible, so disappointed. than i figured ok i\\'ll give them another shot and on their website it said open till 1030 so i got there at 920, the guy picks up menus ready to seat us and just says we\\'re closed. totally rude, and now i have such a bad taste for this place, i would never go back including the upper darby location. what a big flop eventually no one will be going there once it catches on how terrible the food and service is. frank pica should be embarrassed of this disgrace of a restaurant!, i don\\'t see what the fuss is about, since the pizza here is merely ok in my opinion. why? well, i personally don\\'t like the sauce on top of the cheese -- because the cheese merges with the dough, causing its flavor to disappear. however, my main gripe is that the 2-inch diameter pepperoni is sliced so thin -- about 1/32nd of an inch -- that you get less than two ounces of it on a large pie and can hardly taste it!, picas is usually a staple restaurant for me and my family in westchester. we decided to go out this wednesday night for a special treat. it was indeed not a treat . almost everything that we got was horrible compared to normal. the bolognese was very thick like ketchup. they forgot to bring out our wings until the end of the meal and it was blamed on the computer system. the wings are usually delicious and they were horrible i ended up giving them to my dog when i came home. i ordered the fettuccine alfredo which was basically a chicken noodle soup it was so wet. we also ordered a caesar salad and the escarole soup. i usually love the escarole soup and it was salty and cold. i cannot fault the waitress for these things however, the waitress did bring a check to us and i gave her my credit card and when she came back to return my credit card she ended up altering of the food that we ordered on the receipt. that is ridiculous.we will no longer be choosing picas., this was my first time at the west chester location as i\\'ve been to the upper darby location multiple times.  i ordered pizzas to pickup.  first of all they really need a sign closer to west chests pike as the sign is on the building and by the time you see it you are already past the building.  i had to park next door.  i called in 3 pizzas ahead of time  telling them i need it at a certain time.  so i go in the takeout door and they have a system you go to the register and she confirms what you ordered and then you pay.  she gives you a ticket to give to the guy and he read of the ticket and brought over the pizzas.  i went to where the party was and they still screwed up the order.  where the party is has bad cell phone reception so i saw they called about coming back.  first of all where i was was not around the corner and i didn\\'t get the message until 9 at night when i picked up the pizzas at before 4.  they should be more conscientious of they are giving you the right orders so not to inconvenience the customer.  in the end the pizzas were good but have to work on the service., we are frequent customers and usually are very satisfied with our food. however, tonight we ordered a small white veggie pizza. on their menu, it says white is $3 extra and veggie is $6 extra. a little pricey, but wanted to give their white pizza a try thinking it would be amazing! this was not the case. we received a pizza with a ton of cheese, not a traditional white pizza. it was missing the  garlic and ricotta like you would expect on a white pizza. next time i\\'ll just save my money and order a cheese pizza, if thats what picas white pizza is. very disappointed, especially after the additional topping price., ordered takeout the other night and was disgusted to see the manager rearranging food on plates in the window with her bare hands. and this is in the midst of a pandemic. will not ever be returning after what i saw., very disappointed. went there for valentine\\'s day, expecting they would do something to make the evening special for their customers. \\n\\nno cocktail menu or something for themed drinks or anything. then, we got hard bread that was a rock. followed by seafood alfredo which was awful. the sauce tasted like water and the noodles were horrible.\\nthen my wife\\'s crab cakes consisted of two fried ovals thrown on a plate. that\\'s it. no garnish, absolutely nothing to make this a special dinner.\\n\\ntasted awful, and looked awful. no effort whatsoever. ruined valentines dinner., years ago, i\\'ve used to visit pica\\'s in upper darby, until i moved to chester county. so when i passed by the west chester one on rt 3, i really wanted to try it out. so i tried the west chester one out and was disappointed with the outcome. started off by ordering one of their specialty drinks, don\\'t recall the name of it, but it was very good. i then ordered buffalo wings as an appetizer and made it very clear i wanted it well-done. i received them about 10 minutes later, and they were just ok, but not well-done. i like them crispy. the bread was very good. i ordered stuffed (crab)-flounder, string beans and roasted potatoes.  i was very disappointed with the stuffed-flounder. it looked and tasted like something you would purchased in a supermarket, maybe worse. mostly the fish was very thin and tasteless and a bit dried out. the stuffing tasted like it was almost mashed potatoes. no crab meat what-so-ever. i tried to spice it up with salt and pepper. shame i didn\\'t take a photo of it. string beans were ok, better than the main dish. potatoes were just ok, one or two was a tad raw inside. person who i was with ordered the baked rigatoni, which was much better than my dish. i don\\'t usually order seafood at an italian restaurant, but they listed several other seafood dishes, so i took the chance. if i go back i\\'ll stick with traditional italian dishes., i drive past pica\\'s everyday on the way to work. i wanted to eat here for a while as friends constantly rave about the other locations. finally stopped in for lunch with a friend and left disappointed. our waitress was really nice (i knew her from another local restaurant) but the food was not very exciting or tasty. i went safe and had a meatball parm. it\\'s a favorite of mine and this one just didn\\'t have much flavor to it and the meatballs tasted overcooked. my friend had the pizza and while the upside down sauce/cheese thing was odd, i gave it a shot. \\n\\ni\\'m going to hope it was just an off day for the kitchen, but i really didn\\'t enjoy either. given the number of people who seem to love the place, i\\'m going to chalk it up to it being misfire. may try it again someday, but as someone on a fairly strict diet, this was my cheat day and i did feel cheated., its a shame that the staff is completely rude, because i actually enjoy the food.  i have gone 3 times in the past 2 months and the same snotty staff is still working there.  i thought that maybe i got them on a bad day.  sorry... but not worth the awful service., horrible service they took forever with our meals and high priced for skimp food. the wrap they made looked like a rev wrap from walmart. the cheesesteak i ordered was the size of a hot pocket. this place needs to put hair nets on their employees cause the one cook had a full grown beard over the grill. all the kids behind the counter did not know what they were doing. it\\'s basically a greasy mcdonald\\'s., fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me was the lesson to be learned tonight. last time i ordered from them (see my last review) i didn\\'t learn my lesson. i thought maybe they had an off night - it happens to the best of us. but no this place is an epic fail 24/7. first it took 1 hour and 10 mins for a monday night delivery (it was a long wait last time as well). second the food was bad. i ordered a mini cheesesteak for my daughter, it was soggy and super super mini size. hubby ordered a soggy chicken cheesesteak that was kind of on the small side for $9 (skimpy on meat). i ordered buffalo wings. the sauce on the wings were good but omg the wings were dry i\\'m talking really dry like they were cooked in a tanning booth or something. the blue cheese was bad too. for the price paid for such horrible food i felt like a victim of grand larceny. they are a franchise they are supposed to have standards and i have been to other slacks that were good but this one took a wrong turn. they put the slack in slacker. their name should be lacks...because they lack good food. i think i\\'d rather go to the dentist than ever patron this place again and i just may have to those dry blank wings were so hard and dried out i\\'m surprised it didn\\'t crack my teeth.'"
