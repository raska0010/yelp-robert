       "' Poor service, the drive through is open 24 hours, the hours say o p end a t 5 am, it\\'s 5:30, and I can\\'t walk in and buy a cup of coffee, I was told to come back at 6. Well, I\\'m on my way to work with no breakfast while this place is serving food in their drive through. Does not really provide the real philly cheese steak. Very little cheese and meat is in very small pieces. I\\'ve had a lot better. Never going back. After visiting multiple times at this location, I will never be back again. Service was average at best, there seemed to be some dispute between the two bartenders on staff. The manger was never seen and after I called for resolution he had nothing positive to provide, other than, \"can I take down your information?\" There are too many quality restaurants in the area to bother wasting your time here. My sister and I went here for the all you can eat sushi. It\\'s nice that they make your sushi to order but when we ordered our rolls for the all you can eat sushi, the waiter stopped and said \"are you sure you can eat this all?\" I said it\\'s all you can eat right? The waiter said yes and walked away. We were a little insulted and taken back at the fact that the waiter was rude and then walked up to the sushi bar and started talking to the chiefs and they were all starring at us and laughed. Who cares if you order a lot and don\\'t finish it all. Don\\'t make it an all you can eat sushi buffet if you can\\'t handle the orders being out in. Will NEVER recommend this place to anyone nor ever go back! Sushi was good but the service was bad. I\\'m only giving three stars because the food I had was excellent and my boyfriend said his burger was probably one of the best he has ever had. But the service, however, was the worst I\\'ve ever had and I intend on calling tomorrow to hopefully speak with a manager. \\n\\nI didn\\'t catch his name, but he has dark hair and gauges in his ears. I do remember from glancing at my check that I was sitting at Table 31 (in case management is reading this) at 12:30pm just enjoying dinner after my boyfriend was done work. As far as service goes, all this man did was drop off two sodas and we didn\\'t see him again until the meal was over. Now that\\'s whatever because as a restaurant manager... I won\\'t ever leave a terrible tip, because I do understand the nature of the business and tend to give the benefit of the doubt. NOW, my check was $52.92 I believe. It was just shy of $53. I put $65 in the check book and I\\'m 100% positive of that amount as I counted it THREE times to be sure I left a $12 tip. I count money every day of my life. \\n\\nHe comes over and asks if we need change and I politely say \"No thanks, it\\'s all good!\" And he walks RIGHT BEHIND US TO HIS SERVER STATION. So he didn\\'t have far to go with this check book. \\n\\nHe huffs and puffs and comes back over to the table, THROWS THE CHECKBOOK ON MY TABLE and says \"keep the change\". The book only had $2 in it! I said \"I gave you $65... I don\\'t understand why you\\'re throwing $2 at me\" he then continues to argue with me about the tip I left him and stands practically on me until I reach into my purse and hand him ANOTHER $10. This dude got $22 to embarrass me, treat me like a degenerate and all he did was drop two sodas off and input an order. \\n\\nAny server would lose their job for treating a customer that way. How dare he argue the tip when he hastily counted the money I handed directly to him. What a disgrace. I\\'ll never dine here again. The service was horrible and with 3 young children waiting on meals and the adult food comes out first is insane. I feel compelled to write this concerning our recent Thanksgiving Dinner at Supper.We needed vegetarian options which were made known to the restaurant when we made the reservation.The vegetarian option for Thanksgiving was tofu,grilled or broiled, IM not sure,but it was dry and tasteless.I would have expected a restaurant of this caliber and price point, would have and should have been able to make a much better selection, especially for Thanksgiving.My advice to any vegan,vegetarian,celiac, etc, would be to avoid this restaurant. They are either unwilling or incapable of meeting your dietary needs, while still charging you quite a bit! This piece of crap establishment has the worst customer service. Drivers and phone operators don\\'t give a sh*t about you. Pizza room TWO hours from order to door. Will be calling corporate about this location.THE PEOPLE ON THE PHONE LAUGHED AT ME WHEN I SAID MY PIZZA WAS TAKING OVER AN Hour. Went there on Sunday evening in a party of four. Two had steak which they would rate a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10. Two of us had pasta with seafood dishes which we would rate as 2 out of 10. One dish was pasta with shrimp and small lobster tail and the pasta was the consistence of mashed potatoes, covered with a light green sauce that tasted like chicken broth. The other dish was ravioli stuffed with lobster, but it was minced up and was surely some type of faux lobster. The pasta was obviously frozen and it was very undercooked. Also covered by the same green sauce that tasted like chicken broth. Awful food for the seafood dishes and too expensive for what you get. One person complained to the waitress about the mushy pasta and she offered her another side dish. Not very good service either. The bar might be good because it was packed, the restaurant was not. This was the single worst place I have gone too. I actually walked out with my boyfriend before our drinks made it to the table. We waited 25 minutes for a coffee and orange juice. The only time anyone came to our table was when we were seated. I could see a female in the kitchen eating from where I was sitting. There 4 to 5 employees out back smoking when we walked out. Mind you there we\\'re only 2 other tables taken. Did not seem like a professional environment whatsoever. I took a photo of the employees outback and plan on contacting corporate. I have never walked out on a place in my life until now. Terrible service. Average to mediocre.  Ordered then fried chicken and it was overcooked and served lukewarm.  Fries were cold and they barely gave a handful.  Purple coleslaw tasted more like diluted sauerkraut.  Server took 20+ minutes to bring me a cup of hot water after 3 requests and they were moderately busy.  My Sprite came in a child sized glass and not even a refill.  Food was bland, except for all the salt I dumped on it.  I didn\\'t even bother with the dessert.  Go somewhere else. Don\\'t go here.  The food is mediocre & the service is slow.  We went on a FRIDAY night there were only 3 tables taken & the rest of the restaurant EMPTY.  Asked if we had a reservation. For real?  The only thing we really liked were the chips & pico de gallo. SO if you want chips & salsa this is ok place to go to - otherwise try El Tule in Lambertville.....it\\'s a million times better. First, if you want hibachi then you cannot sit in the regular dining room. It is not allowed. Why? What if I want a more private dining experience? Too bad. The sushi was pretty good but it was the worst hibachi I\\'ve had the rice was overcooked and dry like the shrimp. Also, you don\\'t get noodles. Unfortunately that\\'s my favorite part... Might come back for the sushi. First the good news. The pub is pleasant and has a new look. The server was friendly.\\n\\nOur table was covered with powdered cheese, but the server quickly wiped it down. We ordered the pot pie and the chicken breast cheese steak. The kitchen service was very slow. It took at least 20 minutes for the food to arrive. \\n\\nThe pot pie was salty and looked more like a soup. It is covered with a light flaky crust. The chicken breast cheese steak is a medium sized sub roll filled with lettuce and tomatoes. There are chicken chunks across the top. I did not notice the cheese. The sandwich is served with grocery store fries. \\n\\nI looked at the dinners around me wished I had made another choice, but am not sure what I would have chosen. Btw, the YELP pages mentioned taco Tuesday\\'s, but I don\\'t think they do that anymore. No Mexican fare on the menu.\\n\\nWe have been touring area pubs. We won\\'t be back to Bernie\\'s, unless it\\'s just for a cold beer. Sorry for the negative review. It\\'s a shame because their bagels are pretty good. Their service is the main problem, as I had to stand for 15 minutes in a line that was 8 people long. When I eventually reached the cashier he moved incredibly slowly, reminding me of a sloth. I had to repeat my order three times and when I eventually got it, it was the wrong bagel with the wrong spread and seasoning. Never coming back weekday buffet is below average. Would not call it indian food. More like indianized american food since. Sorry good service does not make up for below average food. I hope their dinner and weekend buffet is better. Food was disgusting, at best. The \"pork fried rice\" had no pork or vegetables in it - just yellow rice. The general tsos chicken was burnt breading with little to no meat very lightly covered in a tasteless sauce. The inedible meal was followed by a fortune cookie so stale it could not be chewed. Will never order from this establishment again. Waste of money. This place was truly awful. I am really surprised by all the good reviews. I went here last night with a few friends. We didn\\'t see a table open, so we were about to leave when the waitress insisted that we stay and head upstairs for table service. There were tables, yes, but no service. I had to walk up to the bar for menus and a draft list which was scribbled on a receipt. Not only did no one approach us to ask us if we wanted drinks or menus or anything really, I had to go BACK to the bar to place both our drink AND food order. When I did so, the chef had come out with a plate for someone else and complained that he didn\\'t feel like working anymore.  The bartender, with whom I was speaking and giving my food order, then joked \"I have A LOT more coming for you ha ha.\" \\nThen the food arrived. Since it wasn\\'t the worst part of the evening I will keep it polite and say it was \"mediocre\" but this is a VERY GENEROUS description.\\nIt wasn\\'t late - We arrived around 9-930 so there was no reason for there to be no table service or for the kitchen to be closing. It was a SATURDAY NIGHT. \\nNow I am a drinker - I LOVE beer.  I am not a beer snob by any means, but I also have never left a drink unfinished, but when they started blaring awful club music I got up to get our check (because, lets be real, no one had any intentions of offering it to me or even bringing it to the table) and left my beer half finished.\\nI hardly feel compelled to write reviews - I think I have a small handful on here - but holy hell this place was the pits. This place has a lot of growing pains it needs to go through. Which is surprising because this is the new sister location of the Four Season on Cottman, so they are not first time restaurateur and this is pretty much a duplicate of the Cottman location. So why not bring in some of the experienced staff for the opening weeks until your new staff is fully trained? But what do I know. We went on opening night and the first thing we saw while waiting on was lots of wait staff standing around, most looking lost, and someone from the kitchen staff delivering food to the tables. Like chef coat and pants, someone who should be working the line in the back, bringing food out. This was the reg flag. We were sat after a wait, which when being led to the table made no sense since there were lots of open booths, but whatever. We sat and there was grit on the seats, not a huge deal we wiped it off but something the people clearing the tables should have done. We were then greeted by waiter #1 who took our drink order who proceeded to give it to waiter #2, two minutes later waiter #3 came by and asked if we needed drinks - we informed them that we had already given our order to #1, another 2 minutes later waiter #4 comes by states that she will be our server and ask if we needed drinks - at this point waiter #1 stops and informs her he already took the drink orders from all her tables. Holy confusion Batman! We seriously were not sure who we were going to be tipping at the end. So if there are 4 waiters milling about one section and taking each other\\'s drink orders then why was the kitchen line staff delivering food?!?! On to the food. It was ok, The tomato cheddar soup was good. The salad bar was sad not much fresh veg mostly canned or mayo based salads. Also they ran out of greens and need to keep on top of it more to make sure it is stocked. The rest of the food was just ok. Not bad but nothing special either. I think I will be one and done with this one since there are a multitude of diners in the area and others are much better. I wish them luck. Really wanted to like this place, but they\\'re in major need of a management rehaul.  Stopped by after work (5 hours before closing) and they were out of half the menu.  You\\'d think this would mean the staff would give you a decent-sized portion of the few things they had, but nope, I got 3 pieces of chicken in my bowl.  I get it, I\\'ve worked in food service and sometimes you get slammed, but based on the other reviews, this wasn\\'t a one-time thing.  The ingredients were fresh-tasting, but I doubt I\\'ll be back.\\n\\nIf you do dare to try it, don\\'t bother ordering online, since they don\\'t update the menu with what\\'s out of stock.  The guy ahead of me at the cashier learned that the hard way... It was nice out and I saw they had a few outside tables so I thought I\\'d get some lunch. And honestly, I should have gone somewhere else. \\n\\nFrom a food perspective, nothing was wrong persay, but there was nothing special about it. It was just average. But what really ruined the lunch for me was the service. Maybe because it was busy the waitress had too many tables in her section or something, but she was very inattentive. It took forever to get drinks and then forever again to get some chips and salsa. \\n\\nI\\'ll definitely be going somewhere else next time I want a Mexican, or lunch in general. The other reviewers, especially the vegan ones, seem to have had much more luck than I have when it comes to this place.  The first time, I ordered a mock chicken barbecue sandwich.  What I got was a real chicken sandwich -- thank goodness I cut the thing in half first.  They were prompt in sending me a new sandwich, not charging me for the new one, and they threw in a drink, which was nice.\\n\\nThe second time, I got a seitan cheesesteak, which was alright, but I had ordered \"wings\" as well.  The wings were instead slices of meat that had been soaked in some sort of marinade.  They were binned and my opinion of this place went down.\\n\\nIt\\'s not that the food is awful -- it is decent -- but when you offer food for people with dietary restrictions, you better follow through with what you\\'re offering.  That sort of negligence is playing with fire, especially if someone might have a negative bodily reaction to what you\\'re serving.\\n\\nThe only reason these guys have two stars is that I\\'m a little in love with their vegan cheese fries.  Maybe you non-veggies will have better luck than I did. I\\'ve seen this place for awhile now, and have been wanting to try it.  So today we tried it, and let me say.....I\\'ve had worse and I\\'ve had better.  I probably won\\'t be going back though.  Those shops off of Red Lion are a pain to get in and out of...so it really didn\\'t start off to well.  We were greeted promptly upon entering, and given a menu.  We finally decided and the chick who took our order wasn\\'t too courteous.  So, we waited 20 minutes, which wasn\\'t bad.  Got home and pulled out our order, and it was wrong.  It wasn\\'t a big mistake, but i ordered a full slab with 2 sides and we got 1/2 slab...  so.....  First the sides... The macaroni and cheese I am pretty sure it was kraft mac n cheese or Velveeta from the box. So it sucked.  The \"granny\\'s potato salad..was had too much mayo and tasted bad.  The bbq beans were pretty tasty. I didn\\'t eat any of the bbq chicken, but my husband said it was pretty good.  Soft, tasty, and covered in bbq sauce.  But he would not go back for it.  On to the ribs... They were just blah... Kind of burnt, and fatty.  The bbq sauce was good though....\\nSo.... Save the hassle and go back down the street to Famous Dave\\'s... Just wasn\\'t very good. \\n\\nI had the lemongrass tofu, which was pretty one dimensional. It was just pieces of tofu in a super salty sauce with some bell peppers and onions and every once in a while you could actually taste the lemongrass.\\n\\nBoyfriend had their pho, but wasn\\'t impressed by it at all. He had to add a ton of fixins to it just to give it some flavor. \\n\\nPho and More is waaaaaaaaay better, and the staff is so much friendlier (our waiter at Saigon Main basically just sat and talked on the phone the whole time we were there). This use to be a great stop. But since I\\'d say 2 months ago, it\\'s horrible. The drive thru window is not acceptable. Orders incomplete, not accurate etc. I believe the turnover of staff may be a reason, but actually the staff simply does not pay attention to detail. To much playing, not listening to orders,  and maybe a lack of supervision. If you go here, I suggest going inside and avoid the drive thru at all costs !!!! Stopped in one day for lunch. The bartender was completely rude. If you don\\'t like to serve people from different cultures you shouldnt be in customer service. Will never go back. Between quality and service it was horrible. Don\\'t dine in. Delivery is faster. \\n\\n6:00pm - Sit at an open table\\n6:10pm - Waitress shows up and takes order for drinks and appetizers (water, Mountain Dew, and cheesesticks)\\n6:20pm - Waitress shows up and takes order for main entrée (pizza); she also has no idea what\\'s on the menu... She claims that she is new\\n6:25pm - We get our drinks\\n6:40pm - Realize that we\\'ve been here for forty minutes already\\n6:45pm - Cashier walks out into the dining area and asks everyone what they are waiting for; she, then proceeds to walk in to the kitchen yelling \"where are all the breadsticks at the tables!?\"\\n6:55pm - Waitress comes out with two orders of cheesesticks (one order is on the house apparently); she apologizes for the hold up with the classic \"backed-up kitchen\" excuse;\\n7:05pm - Waitress comes out with our pizza again with the same apologies and excuses\\n7:10pm - A table that came in with us leaves; the guy from that table yells that his order wasn\\'t even taken (an hour of waiting)\\n7:15pm - I ask for boxes and the check\\n7:20pm - I get the boxes and the check\\n7:30pm - I waited too long; I walk up to the pick-up cashier and ask to get the check handled; I leave 2 cents as a tip on a $27.01 tab in front of the clerk; I don\\'t talk to any of the employees; deadpan just look at them as they make excuses and apologize\\n\\nI waited an hour and half to get a mediocre pizza, a mediocre order of cheesesticks, and a complimentary order of mediocre cheesesticks. \\n\\nDraw your own conclusions. I already gave them my two cents. I tore up the cheap cheesesteaks while sitting in a both that had holes in it. Good times. By far the most pretentious restaurant I have ever been to in my entire life.  Went in cold on a Saturday night knowing absolutely nothing about Amada\\'s history or menu.  What followed was a ridiculous joke that could never qualify as a \"meal\".  What we were served could only be described as \"food\" simply because it was matter that passed through my digestive system and did not kill me.  \\n\\nThe veil meatballs were about the size of my thumbnail and had absolutely zero flavor.  The crab stuffed peppers were about the size of an infant\\'s toe and again, tasted like nothing.  The chicken skewers were over salted to the point where it physically hurt to eat them.  At one point we were brought a dish that was just straight tuna fish out of a can.  No lie.  Not even good tuna, chunk light.  \\n\\nFor how expensive this place is I would expect some level of competence in the food, but sadly it\\'s just a trap to swindle people out of their money.  Don\\'t eat here.  It\\'s a total scam. EW.  This place is GROSS.  I fail to see the charm in this cramped, suffocating, and smelly bar.\\n\\nIn and out in less than 30 seconds, and still increased my chance of lung cancer by 34,165,213%.  No thanks! We stopped at many places.  This was my least favorite.\\n\\nThey have a large beer selection.  It would have been nice to get a sample since there were so many to choose from.  We have gone to other places where the server actually suggests it.  But our waitress seemed rushed.  She didn\\'t offer a sample and after explaining what we like, she didn\\'t have much advice to offer.  We only stayed for 1 drink (about 30 minutes) and she reminded us she would be getting off soon.  It wasn\\'t a warm, inviting experience.\\n\\nWe didn\\'t stop for food so I\\'m not sure how that is.  We were seated at a table towards the back.  It was nice that there were a lot of windows so it wasn\\'t dark.  We will not go back. If i believed in a god, i would damn him for creating a being capable of making an establishment like Greek Lady. \\nThis place makes me want to have sex with a chainsaw.  \\nI came into this place thinking i was going to be served imitation greek food, but i was dead wrong..... i was served imitation greek food prepared by a UPENN kid! Usually when i goto a ethnic place to eat i expept someone of that ethnicity to me making the food.....my logic is obviously flawed in this respect.\\nOne of the nightmarish creations i attempted to eat here was the \"vegetarian gyro\"......i should of ordered a priest to come with it because this abomination was something that i couldn\\'t handle alone.  from the outside it looked alright.... but on the inside learked something much fouler... this vegetarian thing was basically french fries....yes, french fries saturated in cucumber yogurt ( a hefty ice cream scoop worth) lettuce tomato onion inside a pita. it was revolting...   and i had to toss it. \\nthe pepsi i bought was delicious though... worth the trip. This is a frustrating bar to review. It has some great pluses, but the minuses are so much more.\\n\\nThe unfriendly, unresponsive bartenders who don\\'t seem to care if you ever come back.\\nThe food STINKS!  Once i got sliders...easy enough to cook you would think...they were like rubber. the sliders were half the size of the bun, so it was thick bread and overcooked meat. Next time I got a \"pulled pork\" sandwich.  sounds good...but it wasn\\'t pulled pork...it was sliced pork which was ENTIRELY different. it was a decent sandwich, but it wasn\\'t what was advertised. \\n\\nOkay, so trivia night was nice and there are a ton of tv\\'s to watch games...but if the food is awful and the help sucks...what is the point of going. \\n\\nThis place could be good...but it isn\\'t...new management would help!! They need to be removed from reservations! Never seated when stayed reservations 7:15 now 7:56 still waiting on table! Seated 7:59  ok set time setting reservations here! Chef Ramsey couldn\\'t save this place. Beyond bad. Wow this place is horrible! 1.5 hours to get dinner delivered tonight. When it arrived it was cold and tasted like crap anyway! What a waste.\\nPizza: crust tasted like it had been pre baked and day around for a week.\\nFries: ice cold\\nCost: way tooooo much! Not my favorite food cart by far. The chicken tika masala was like tomato soup, very little chicken and lacked spice and flavor, the nan was chewy....first and last time I\\'ll go there. This place is literally only getting two stars from me because of the delicious biscuits and ambiance. Ordered the lump crab cake and it was way too fishy tasting. My boyfriend ordered a $50 dollar steak that was more bland then paper. I wanted to complain to them about their subpar food but I was so eager just to get out of there. I could\\'ve made a more flavorful steak on my frying pan. Super expensive and wasn\\'t even worth the steak at all. Extremely disappointed after all the reviews I\\'ve heard from them. Most likely not coming back. Ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad last night.  Pretty disappointing.  The lettuce was wilted and the chicken tasted like frozen grilled chicken from Sam\\'s Club, which is not great. Probably not going again. My family had been coming here for many years since they love sushi /seafood and who doesn\\'t love great buffet. But we were there last night and noticed the food there was not very fresh. It seems the quality has gone down. The oysters were not fresh (sorry to say, really gross) and the sashimi was just a tad too old with their rubbery texture. The wait staff was friendly but the man who was working the crepes/udon/hibachi bar was as miserable as he could be. He was not about to smile at anyone and I was afraid to ask for more. It seems like the people making the sushi and such looked really miserable too.\\n\\nI\\'ve been to other Minado locations out of state and they are fantastic, so it\\'s a shame this location has gone downhill. When seafood is not fresh that is the worst! People can get sick. A friend recommended that we go to Rich\\'s because it\\'s a local Delicatessen. Unfortunately the food leaves a lot to be desired. I ordered a shrimp salad platter which basically is a shrimp salad salad.  I didn\\'t want the egg salad which automatically comes with the shrimp salad and they did not offer to substitute anything in its place without telling me they have to charge me extra.  I got over this quickly thinking that perhaps the salad itself would be delicious. And I have to admit it was very plain and not very exciting to the taste buds. The container was full of iceberg lettuce, white onion some tomato and shrimp salad. None of the food in the container would entice me to visit this particular Delicatessen again. And it\\'s unfortunate because I like to support my local restaurant or Deli owner. This is the worst Target I have ever been to. It looks shiny and new but the sales-floor staff is deplorable. I have been hung up on when I\\'ve called to see if things are in stock. I have been walked away from by sales floor team members. I have been ignored by sales floor team-members while they talked on their walkies after I had asked them a direct question.  As other reviews have said, it seems to be night and day between the attitudes of the cashiers and sales floor staff.  The cashiers have been downright cheerful every time I\\'ve been to this location. I have worked at different targets in other states and this store must have a high turnover or something because I do not know how these people can stay employed for very long acting the way they do. Bartender that works there during the day is miserable.  Doesn\\'t say hello or thank you.  Not a friendly place. Looks like they have a lot of good items here, I stopped in today... the guy behind the counter was talking A WHILE with another guy and did not bother to say hello or greet me, okay no biggie, but when he was done and I was clearly in eye shot of him, he still never said hello, nod to me, or ask me if I needed anything or needed help with anything instead he instead ignored me. I walked around the entire store, and then he directed his attention to the guy that just walked into the shop, and said \"Hello! How are you?\" and \"can I help you with anything?\" and it made me feel very very ignored. What am I chopped liver? I might come shop here again but it will not be because of the good service.   Just a little constructive criticism-- when any customer walks into your store (whether they are a woman, man, tall, short or fat)  you should GREET them and say, \"Hello, I\\'ll be with you in a minute.\" It is so important. And then  return to help them. I thought it was very rude the way he ignored me. I then left cause I didn\\'t feel like buying anything from this guy. This was absolutely horrible! I am not one to ever post negative things, but i felt it would be a public diservice not to! I ordered my food and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. I arrived, and they said there were several orders ahead of mine. An hour and 5 minutes later my food was ready. I got shrimp wonton soup that tasted like dirty water, and chicken pad thai and crap/pineapple fried rice. These dishes had NOOO taste and were so over cooked it was 2 containers of mush. I felt like I was eating babyfood...mushy with no seasoning! Not to mention, when i walked in all I saw were dented cans on the shelves, which i presume was what was going in my food. I will not be returning to this place.... EVER! if you want someplace good for thai go to the place on the corner of ridge and leverington. That place is good! We took our 3 year old Granddaughter here for the \"petting zoo (?)\" and ice cream.  I guess it is nice that it is offered but definitely a disappointment.  Not what we expected.  Hard to see any animals as they were in fenced in cages with an extra fence keeping guests further away. Most animals were not even visible. The smell was dreadful.  Not sure why we thought it was a petting zoo...no petting going on at all. It actually looked depressing for these animals.  We left 4 minutes after we arrived. Our 3 year old didn\\'t even want ice cream at this point. If we had more time, we would have continued on to Elmwood Park Zoo in Norristown...one of our favorites. The food is a major disappointment; the service was chaotic, confused, and amateurish. The noise level was deafening! It was Friday night, happy hour, granted, but it was impossible to have a conversation. The waitress forgot to serve half our order. She tried to give our broccoli rabe to another table, then went wandering around, asking diners at other tables, \"Did you order this?\" Finally, she got to our table. The food was worse than ordinary. I am a vegetarian and this was the pits!! The broccoli rabe---you could choke on it, it was so stringy. I\\'m not going back to this pretentious wannabe. Give me Vedge or Mi Lah any day. My advice: Don\\'t even consider this over-priced disappointment of a restaurant.If I could give it no stars, I would. Worst rip off ever. Saint James is so egregious I created a yelp account just to warn innocent bystanders. Service is mediocre at best. Prices through the roof and my best description of my meal is dry dog food. However the fries are great, but is it too much to offer ketchup without having to  ask? Why can\\'t I rate ZERO stars? I got food here several times.  Most of the time it was pretty good.  I recently got the lasagna and it was terrible.  I don\\'t know how they can call a bowl full of tomato sauce,  maybe 3 little chunks of noodle, and a glob of cheese on top lasagna.  I ended up just throwing it out.  Really pissed me off.  I\\'ve gotten stuffed shells before and it was pretty good so I figured it would be worth a try, I was wrong.  Oh and the garlic bread had so much garlic on it it was it was not edible. Brutal..  I\\'ll probably go there again because of previous experiences.  Just wont get lasagna The wings were lousy hardly any meat on the bones...and one was actually the bone just deep fried to the point of cremation.  So instead of 10 pc I got 9 measly pcs.  It\\'s ashame been here before and they were better.  Pizza is hopefully better than their wings! Took friends from out of town here for dinner last night and what a disaster! I don\\'t know what was going on with their cooling system but it was so unbearably hot that it ruined our experience. Sweat was literally pouring out of our bodies as we tried to eat our expensive dinner. We had to cut the meal short and go somewhere else it was so bad. This has always been one of our favorite places but the food wasn\\'t as good as we\\'ve had in the past either. I know Jose Garces is going through some difficulties and it showed at the restaurant last night. Not sure we\\'ll ever go back. Sad that the young man has such a bad demeanor.  Food great.   Kid at the front lines miserable.   Lets move someone else into that position please. Had some visitors from Europe to take out to dinner and since my fortuitous Restaurant Week meal at Chifa\\'s last year was generous and good (I was invited to a birthday party), I made reservations and braved the snow.\\n\\nThis year\\'s selection was less generous - reduced to five things - plenty, as it turned out, given Chifa\\'s dependence on rich, creamy sauces.  Of course we devoured the pork belly buns with gusto, my favorite dish of the evening.  As the eager servers brought all the other plates at once, I noticed that my guests started to stay away from the repetitive red cream sauces that covered so many dishes - the red curry rice with tofu, the shrimp and noodles, even the Ecuadorian seviche tasted as if it were slathered in ketchup.  While the menu lists a flurry of ingredients for each dish, the insipid saucing covered all nuance and filled everyone up in that funny way that calls for several eau-de-vie digestives or a bracing grappa.  One dish, the \"scallion pancakes\", brought small disks of fried dough that sorely lacked in scallions and was a dud.  The \"spring rolls\" were also terrible, with undefinable filling.\\n\\nIt was clear by the over-eager way our plates were removed that our table was expected to turn over fast.  Every time I looked up, another plate was gone, no matter how much was still on it.  While we wanted some of the early plates back, we were actually glad that the last dishes were taken away speedily because by then we could not even look at those heavy sauces any longer.\\n\\nThe waiters were eager for us to try some cocktails and they looked good, even though we preferred to sample the small but well chosen beer list.  Not to our liking was the hype about the special dish that purportedly was \"amazing\" but would not count as a prix-fixe selection but rather would be added to the bill.  Given the heaviness of almost all other dishes, we were glad we passed on the special. Went for lunch with group of six people and two babies. We ordered appetizers, drinks, mains, and sides. The food was great, the service and time it took to get our food not so much. We waited an insane amount of time. So much so that despite the food being good, I would definitely hesitate to go back, especially if I had something else to do in the next three hours. The servers never gave us an update on the food and failed to bring out some of the drinks we had ordered. Then, to top it all off, they slapped a mandatory tip amount on because we were a group of more than six -never mind that we were only more than six because of two babies who didn\\'t eat anything. Argh. This Target is full of employees, but none of them work. No one answers the phone. Customer service couldn\\'t care less. The last time I was there, two employees were having a spirited foul-mouthed discussion about the football game. So, good luck and ground your expectations. ‼STOP DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!!!!‼\\n\\nThis is the worst I ordered my food over 1 1/2 ago..we still do not have it, I called 15 minutes ago and was told they are on there way....I called back twice, the man answering the phone was rude and hung up on me.. I will yelp, google etc..do not order from here.. \\nthe food was was barely warm...and really soggy, cheese steak and tenders with fries...\\n\\n‼AGAIN DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM‼ The food is pretty good.  I will give them that, and that is why this review has 2 stars instead of 1.  I live on Main Street in Manayunk and frequent many of the restaurants.  I had been there two times before and the food was pretty good and the service was decent as well.  \\n\\nHowever this time, I went in on a Monday evening an hour before they closed.  We were seated immediately by a man who seemed unhappy to see us and unhappy to seat us, and brought water.  Unfortunately that is where the service ended. With only two other tables being used in the restaurant and 3 service employees working in the front we were 100% ignored for 24 minutes.  We were never given a menu and no one ever came to our table.  The man who seated us went out of his way to ignore me many times.  I attempted to make eye contact with him several times to which he looked at me and went and did something completely unproductive, like quickly wipe a table that had not been used, or just walk around.  I attempted to use hand signals again to no avail.  Finally after 24 minutes I went to the front desk where a young woman was working and was greeted with a \"whats up?\"  I explained to her that I was trying to get everyone in the restaurants attention and we have been sitting there for 24 minutes completely ignored.  She acted somewhat surprised and tried to hand me a menu to which I some what laughed and told her we were leaving.  Which we did. \\n\\nIt was glaringly obvious the man just did not want us to eat there and instead of tell us so he let us sit and blatantly ignored more for nearly a half hour.  I have never been so insulted in a restaurant in my entire life.  It is comforting that I read 2 other reviews that had similar experiences.  At least I know this place has the worst service of any midscale restaurant I\\'ve ever been to.  \\n\\nNeedless to say I will NEVER give this restaurant my business again.  I had been recommending this restaurant to my friends due to the food being pretty good, but I will make sure they all know never to eat here.  If you value service in anyway, you will be absolutely insulted to pay these prices to get treated like dirt.  Don\\'t eat here! Today is a Wednesday night which I did not expect Blackhorse Tavernn to be busy.  Unfortunately I was wrong.  Last time I was there with my family, the service was very slow but food was okay.  However, today was the worst  experience I ever had there. We got a waitress which ignored us after we told her the calamari was fishy.  She gave me some *%^$ execuse about how the fishy smell was coming from my son\\'s fish and chip plater.  She continued to explain how the fish and chip should be fishy due to its batter.  Remember I was talking about the calamari now not the fish and chip.  I am an experienced cook and knows the smell of unfresh seafood.  I just let it go with this issue but we sure did not eat the calamari anymore. My younger son got the sliders as his entree.  Unfortunately, it was not very good either. The bread on my son\\'s sliders were stale.  We only told our waitress about the calamari, but after that she did not come by.  When we finished with our dinner, she did not take our plates away like she did with everyone else around us. She also walked around filling other people\\'s water glasses except for ours.  I used to like this place but after this experience, I will never return.  Good luck going there to get a decend service and food!! My first time in Applebee\\'s and it was a disaster. I went with a friend to have dinner. When we arrived around 5:30, they were still doing the shift change so it was a bit slow to sit down, but understandable. From there, everything started to go downhill. The waitress who took our order was not very knowledgeable of the menu and couldn\\'t get our order right. We asked for water and came in 10 mins after we order. When they brought the food, both my friend\\'s and mine were incomplete and when we asked the waitress for an explanation it took her 2 mins to realize what was going on. She was definitely lost. Finally, when we received our check, there was an extra charge for playing a game in tablets they have on the table that we didn\\'t play. \\n\\nOverall a big disappointment. If I could leave no stars I would. In town for a meeting and we Went in for brunch with some coworkers heard ok things about this place but when we walked in to be seated we were seated by someone named Lisa M. Let me tell you, We didn\\'t feel welcomed when we first opened the door . Her attitude and appearance made me Alone want to leave but I thought I\\'d give it a shot. She first tried to cram us in a small booth until one of us asked for something bigger which seemed like such an inconvenience due to her attitude then on top of that I\\'m not too sure if the lady can count because she shorted us a menu. Needless to say id never recommend or return to this diner again. Lisa M needs to be in the back or better trained with customer services! Such a shame. Food was decent. Though for the price I prefer Hummus Grill. And the kicker was I spotted a bug right under my feet as I was standing up to leave. Will not be back. This review is based on customer service and the rude encounter I had with one of the employees. I went on a Sunday, which I know can be extremely busy. I placed my order and waited. I see that a couple of people behind me already had their orders made. No biggie, maybe their drinks were easier to make. A few mins past by and I\\'m still waiting. I went up to the counter to make sure my order was not mistaken given to the wrong person or misplaced (it happened before) I asked nicely but the guy with the handlebar mustache rudely and rolling his eyes said something that was condescending to me. I wasn\\'t demanding my drink to be made at this second. I was simply asking a question and he can just say it\\'s coming up or reassured me that it\\'s still there.  It\\'s super unfortunate because I really like La Colombe. Now, I don\\'t think I can go there without worrying about poor customer service. The man here is sooo rude. I asked for two bubble teas he would not receive the order and just run away from us. He has no manners at all. He told us to wait for an extra 20 minutes for 2 drinks and there were no customers at this point. Do not come to this place. Food is bad too. Beware of the menu title and its description (LACK OF). We ordered something called \"Pork stir fry with Vegetable\" and when it came out it was bacon and scallion! Yeah it\\'s pork, but that\\'s FAR from what you would expect just from the title with no description. Obviously there\\'s more to why they deserve a ONE Star. Service was horrible, we didn\\'t even get any menu when we seated. Dishes were not cleared until we were standing up to leave! Nobody came by to check to see if our food was ok. Asked for an extra bowl of rice, the waitress just starred at me and walked away with no acknowledgement that she heard me. Horrible experience for a fancy looking Chinese restaurant! i have a special nickname for this place: McAttytood\\'s \\n\\nwhenever i am too broke to catch a bite at the Fresh Grocer or other better-heeled local establishments, i go in here..and remember why i dont visit that often.\\n\\nat least they renovated the interior, it was really kinda grody for years. but even with the upgrade in appearance, the service is poorer than that of the Mickey D\\'s by the Broad and Olney SEPTA station (and that is some kind of achievement in itself).\\n\\neven if all i want is a couple items off the dollar menu, it takes FOREVER...and then i have to deal with the banter of the employees bitching about their job and about each other, when they arent dealing with customers they obviously cant stand. and then since the place is 24/7 - you get a nice mix of college students/homeless/crazy/west philly locals that always provide unintentional street theater.\\n\\nif you HAVE to get mickey d\\'s or dont have a lot of money to hit up the much better options in the area, just get your McKibbles N Bits and clear out - its not worth the aggravation of even sit down snacking.\\n\\nbut you know what, Crown Fried Chicken is RIGHT next to the El Stop at 40th and market...you can get the same quality food and there\\'s an ATM! Not sure how this place can be rated higher than ten stone two blocks down south street. Small, mediocre food and grungy look and feel... My husband and I tried this place for brunch (breakfast menu) today, basically because we had a $5 off coupon.  We had the unfortunate luck to  be assigned a surly, miserable waitress.  From the first minute, we knew she had an attitude problem.  My husband ordered a breakfast combo platter that came with bacon and sausage that he asked for very well done.  I ordered the poached eggs with jumbo lump crab meat, with DRY whole wheat toast.  \\n\\nWhen the food came, and the waitress basically dumped it on the table, my husband\\'s bacon was barely cooked.  My toast didn\\'t arrive until 10 minutes after my entree, after asking another server to find out where it was.  When our server delivered it, she made a very rude comment to me--\"I told you I was getting it.\"  Not appreciated.   It turned out to be buttered, but I didn\\'t want to get into it again with her, so I just didn\\'t mention  it .The fresh fruit that was included with both our meals was not ripe and inedible.    We had to ask a busboy to locate the waitress to send back the bacon to have it  cooked  more, and also get a coffee refill.  She plunked down a small pot of coffee on our table without comment, and never did bring back the bacon.  \\n\\nWe had to ask yet another server to get us the check, which we took to the front desk and spoke to the manager about the problems we encountered.  We explained to him why we were not leaving her a tip and he apologized for the service.\\n\\nWe dine out very frequently and sometimes the service is hit or miss, but this experience was in a class by itself. I can only comment on the employees\\' attitude because I stopped in to buy loose leaf tea. The barista was really rude and stared me down... I would have stayed for a coffee but didn\\'t want to deal with the angry staff for a second longer. Not even close to the Pietro\\'s on Walnut Street in Center City.  First of all, way too many little kids.  Screaming, running around inside and out, and typhoid like coughing.(Interesting side note:  There have been 8 cases of whooping cough identified at Radnor High School.)  Ewwwww.  The waitress was efficient, but a little curt.  The bread is good...toasted.  The atmosphere is nice, but if you like the Pietro\\'s in center city, this place will be a huge disappointment.  But if you looking for a step up from a McDonalds with an indoor playground, this place may fit the bill. Like others have posted - the place looks great! They really transformed what used to be the Snow White diner.  Outside of that it feels like this place opened before it was really ready - the staff seem confused/lost most of the time and the food was mediocre.\\n\\nI went in last night for happy hour and went to the upstairs bar - the outside patio looked gorgeous but we were told that we could not get happy hour specials out there. The deck was completely empty and I would have loved to sit outside but not if I have to pay full price for something that I can get at the bar for half price!! That seems ridiculous.  \\n\\nThere was only one bartender and the place got pretty full and he seemed very overwhelmed and uncertain about the beers available on tap - which was the only drink special - you would think he would know them inside and out.\\n\\nOrdered a pizza (which was $3 off at the bar) and an appetizer of white bean dip.  Pizza was super soggy and not very warm. Overall the experience was a disappointment.\\n\\nHopefully this place will work out the hiccups of opening and realize that if they want the afterwork crowd to visit they need to step it up a bit! We ate here last year and could not believe how delicious the cheesesteak sandwich was. We returned a yr later, 7/11/18, and were extremely disappointed. They changed the sandwich. They now use some chemically created yellow guck called cheese, they use lettuce as fillers to add less beef, the sandwich was watery and the bread was rubbery. Overall, it was tasteless. \\nIf it ant broken, don\\'t fix it I always say. On a quest to finding a better cheesesteak sandwich. This is blasphemy to all true vegan bakeries.  It makes me sad that they fall into so many vegan stereotypes.  Vegan bakeries are usually the best!!  However this bakery is absolutely awful.  They really do serve \"hockey puck\" quality food.  It\\'s a shame.  Shame on you for being a low quality, disgusting example of vegan goodness. Ordered a prosciutto pizza and some buffalo wings for pick up. Total was $27 excluding tip. Was disappointed to find out that there was a special going on for 2 large pizzas for $17 that we didn\\'t know about. Also, if you order online, you save 5%. Missed out on that too.\\n\\nPlace was pretty empty on a Friday night.\\n\\nPizza was average - sauce was a little on the sweet side. There wasn\\'t much prosciutto (if any) on the pie, and very little slices of tomato or basil. After one bite, the cheese fell off. Like slid right off the pizza. This continued with every slice that was eaten. Really annoying. \\n\\nWings were on the soggy side. Tasted like Frank\\'s Hot Sauce on it.\\n\\nOverall nothing special. If you\\'re a regular at the bar then you might get good service,  but the rest of us are it of luck.  Took 5 friends in wing night,  thinking a local dive would do it right.  Wrong. The oil was old,  and the wings too,  and dry.  Only 1 flavor resembled anything edible, and the second batch of that was a failure as well.  Service was awful. Food was slow even when The dining room was empty.   The lady was always annoyed to have to leave her party at the packed bar to get us food out drink,  and treated the family next to us the same.  Drinks are over priced,  watered down,  and well is often found in top shelf drink requests.  Never again. CHANGED MY RATING:\\nCONTACTED BY CUSTOMER SERVICE with steps to address the issues mentioned below.  Really appreciate someone willing to make the changes necessary.  Will give them another try.\\n\\nHow many reviews about poor customer service do you have to read before you do something about it?  My gosh, you are a business, right?  You rely on CUSTOMERS!  Every time I ask for my dozen bagels to be sliced, you should see the look on their faces.  I think this is part of the JOB.  We just moved here from another state and after 1 month of trying this bagel shop, we\\'ll never go back.  Keep your rotten customer service and see how many people come in.  You\\'re not the only bagel place in the area.\\n\\nOh, also, when I asked a manager why the clerk slicing my bagels was allowed to have her hair hanging in her face without a hat on, he told me they didn\\'t have to wear hats, that a ponytail was \"good enough\".  With no hat and 90% of your hair hanging over my bagels, it\\'s not a very appetizing sight and I know this is not in accordance with the Health Department. Don\\'t go for the food, but go!  Especially during lovely weather. A favorite hangout but most of the entrees (and we\\'ve had several over the years) are mass produced and not always hot or fresh. This visit we had a great table outdoors, wonderful cocktails and beet salad but the entrees of boulliabaise and lamb shank were meh. Still the people watching and sipping a drink in the sun was a wonderful time before heading over to the Curtiss for a student recital. Our fries were stone cold little bits and pieces (immediately replaced with a much nicer serving when I asked) and the table next to us sent back a trout dish. Our waitress shouldn\\'t have accepted the fries from the kitchen and even delivered them to us in the first place they were so sub par imho. We were not offered bread. \\n\\nNext time will skip the entree and do salads. BEWARE the wine list.  The mark-up on bottles of wine are close to 5X.  A bottle of Faustino VII which sells at retail down the street for $12.99 is priced at $63 on the wine list.  Also, don\\'t expect to have conversation in this restaurant, we had to shout across the table to be heard, the background noise level is VERY VERY high. It is clear that this location lacks functional management to support the needs of their business. We arrived at 6:15pm and were told that it would be a 20 minute wait. After having waited 45 minutes we asked how much longer and the hostess was unable to give a definitive answer. After we were finally seated which was roughly 7:15pm it took another 10 minutes for someone to come to the table. Clearly during this time of year they do not have the staff to support the significant amount of foot traffic. In addition, the entrees we ordered were incorrect. We won\\'t be going here again. Food: 1\\nDecor: 1.5\\nAmbiance: 1.5\\nService: 3\\nValue: 1.5\\n\\nBiggest Gripes:\\n- Burger tasted like a hot dog. Don\\'t know what was going on with the meat. \\n-Peanut shells everywhere and stickiness everywhere. Similar in vibe to a corporate farmers market. Service was terrible!! When we arrived at 945 pm the service was complaint about how she was \"double sat\"... upon ordering drinks I was told I can\\'t order anymore ice tea due to they didn\\'t wanna make anymore for the night!! Me and 2 buddy\\'s ordered a few appetizers at which were brought out one at a time and when we asked for extra sour cream the server brought out a large container of sour cream for us to share...I ordered mild bones less wings and they brought out hot then refused to take em back an give me mild!! Needles to say the service sucked..I will not return to this location! Came here later on a Saturday night, so that might factor into it. Basically I\\'d say this was mediocre. Mushy tomatoes, dry and crackly pita, too much lettuce. Aside from that, they do have good falafel and the humous is very refined and authentic. I have a feeling we just went at a bad time and didn\\'t get the full treatment.  Was disappointed because the reason we chose this place was that everyone said they serve you fresh pita out of the oven. We didn\\'t get that. Disappointed.  Service was slow and only fair.  Briscket with gnocci was very salty and a small portion.  Chopped salad was the bright part of the evening (and very large). Went in for soup dumpling as that was advertised as their specialty. But the crabmeat dumplings I ordered did not taste right. Hours after I had them, I ended up having food poisoning. Should have trusted my taste bud and not eaten them. Not sure if it was just a bad batch but will not trust the quality of food there or return. I have never written a review online but I have been to this establishment twice now and each time was terrible. The first time it took forever to get our food and it was just a salad and roast pork sandwich, the salad came with two small chicken tenders for a little over 6 bucks and the roast pork was dry and the broccoli rabe was cooked to mush. Second time the only thing I got was a cheesesteak with cheddar cheese sauce then they told me it took forever because they had to remake it cause they put American cheese on it on accident. Well they put the cheddar on top but left the American on the bottom, oh and I ordered it with onions and there was none on it. Rarely do places make this bad of impression twice. Support one of the local pizza places instead. If u want authentic italian street food go to south philly cause this place is worse then subway. I ordered spicy chicken but the chicken pieces were not spicy at all. The cole slaw was bad. This place hands-down has the worst service I have ever experienced. The first time, I gave them the benefit of doubt. But the second time I realized that wallowing in the doldrums of mediocrity would be a monumental step up for their staff.\\n\\nDuring our hour and a half wait for our food, the waiter did stop by a few times and apologize that it was taking so long. Countless tables around us arrived, received and finished their meals. Once the food finally arrived, only one of our four dishes was the correct order. But no matter, for the waiter\\'s sympathy provided all the nourishment we could handle.\\n\\nClearly this is unacceptable and therefore we asked to speak to the manager. Yes, he admitted, in the springtime their outdoor section gets very busy. Based on the tone of his response, hiring more wait staff had clearly never crossed his mind.\\n\\nIn keeping with his already stellar handling of the situation, the manager seemingly had an epiphany on how to resolve this matter. \"You know what; don\\'t worry about it.\" I\\'m not sure if he was insinuating that we were being relieved of the bill for food we didn\\'t eat, or if he was offering advice for our spiritual well-being.\\n\\nSo, we left, and confused anger filled the void that hunger once occupied. After hearing so many wonderful comments about Brown Betty desserts, I was excited to try their new location. To be honest, I only wanted to try two, but since I only had my debit card (and they have a $10 minimum), I had to buy four cupcakes at $3/each. I figured I\\'d try the \"nudies\" line that I\\'d heard so much about (only the Rum nudie was available). First of all, they didn\\'t have any bags, just an adhesive strip that was to be attached to the bag. I liked the idea. It seemed eco-friendly, too bad it wasn\\'t effective for transporting the cupcakes home on the subway. By the time, I got home, my once lovely cupcakes looked like sat upon TastyKakes. The texture wasn\\'t much better. They were rubbery & tasted like they were at least a day old. I took one bite out of each & threw them away. if I could ask for a refund, I would. From here on out, I\\'m sticking to Miel, Flying Monkey, and Naked Chocolate. I could probably find a food truck that serves better quality cupcakes. They just turned off the game I spent 3 hours watching with 3 seconds to go. The outcome was still in doubt. I am absolutely FURIOUS right now. I go there at least every other week to watch an out of town game, probably will never go again. The game they turned to hadn\\'t even started yet. Total blunder by a \"sports\" bar. Damnit. Terrible service by the manager. My friends and I were turned away at the door after a customer began arguing with us. The manager quickly took their side without being aware of the situation and we decided to go spend our money next door at Rouge. I definitely think it was because we are Hispanic and the couple and manager were white. So sad to have this happened in the city. I was embarrassed and will never return. If you are Hispanic or a fellow minority, please go spend your money next door. Forget about all the other shops in town that you see on tv with the lights and big neon signs.....If you go anywhere else, you\\'re wasting your time. Stop in and experience it for yourself. If you don\\'t like it, then your taste buds are DEAD. This past Saturday was the third, and last time I ate at this place. At the outset, the owner is a rude and nasty person. More on this later My husband likes the food and it\\'s close to the theatre. Food is decent and service was good, until this past Saturday. \\nI confirmed my Open Table reservation at the front desk. We were seated a bit later than our reservation because the place was a madhouse. Our waiter was indifferent, yet attentive to some other tables. Courses were very late to come out; appetizer was not what we ordered but we ate it anyway because it was close enough and pretty good( and we needed to make a curtain). Could not get bread or water refilled, while the same waiter circled our table to make sure the people next to \\nus had theirs refilled regularly. We weren\\'t offered dessert. No one bothered to take our coat check to get our coats; I had to go back and hunt for them\\n\\nDuring the meal Open Table emailed me to ask why we didn\\'t show up. When I tried to talk to the owner about the glitch, he became belligerent , claimed to check his computer and said we never had a reservation. And to call Open Table. When I contacted Open Table, they said the restaurant reported us as a \"no show\".  The owner probably saved a couple of dollars with that ploy. Too many good restaurants in Philadelphia to bother with this place Food was below average and pricey for the quality. The charcuterie was the worst I\\'ve ever tasted. The meats tasted artificial. Short ribs were dry. Tamale fries was not as described. Would not be returning. So incredibly disappointed with the service we received at Parc. Came in with a party of 4 for brunch on Saturday. It was hectic inside, so the restaurant placed us on their wait list with an expected 20-25 min wait time. We went for a walk around Rittenhouse park in the meantime and 45 min later, we still had not received a text. We made our way back to Parc to inquire about our reservation at which point I received a text and was asked to stand to the side to be seated. We patiently waited another 20 minutes until I again inquired about our reservation and the restaurant realized we were not entered into their system and still had no table in the works. It took about 1.5 hours to finally get seated for brunch. The restaurant kindly comped our beverages and apologized profusely, but I was pretty put off to the level of disorganization. \\n\\nFood was ultimately tasty. By the time we got seated it was 12:30pm, so we were not sure if we had wanted brunch or lunch and ordered a mix. \\n\\nI would come back to Parc for a relaxed dinner, but do not recommend busy weekend brunch hours. Friday night was one of the worst meals I\\'ve had in the greater Philadelphia area. Absolutely terrible. Was here about a year or so ago and it wasn\\'t bad and enjoyed it. I\\'ve lived in San Diego for years and been to Mexico numerous times so appreciation for Mexican food in a rural area of Bucks County I thought it was decent. Friday night cold chips, was told they don\\'t have hot chips in back, guacamole was terrible and not surprised if store bought, the margarita was tequila and water and salt. Just awful. I spent $70 there with my wife and kids and will never go back. Fish tacos smelled rancid and honestly was sick to my stomach going home. I really try and give respect to a restaurant or people on a bad night as it\\'s the lifeline for their business on yelp but this was just horrible and no service from management. Too bad as it\\'s a nice layout and could be a good restaurant. Not worth the one star. They need to fix the circulation in their space or something. This place smells like rotten cabbage. And I can testify not all Asian grocery stores smell like this. Their produce is very poor quality. For example, if you pick up a thing of mushrooms, you can probably eat 70% of it because 30% of them (usually ones on the bottom) is already rotten. And you\\'d better eat them that day; otherwise, you end up throwing away most of them.\\n\\nOn the flip side, they have a lot of variety of sauces, dry food, canned food from various Asian countries (Chinese and South Asian focus, although they have Japanese & Korean stuff). Food is to die for. But the staff sucks and wasn\\'t very unprofessional. I come from south philly (almost 20 minute drive ) and they just canceled my order \\nSo I had to reorder and just drive around for 20 minutes because they\\'re is no parking. Disappointing Finally had the opportunity to try this place out but not sure if we\\'ll be back. I ordered a braised chicken torta and ehh it was okay. The quality of the chicken and bread was good but there was barely any sour cream or avocado on the sandwich. Overall the sandwich was pretty plain, far from your traditional torta, and was pretty dry. The traditional and fried fish tacos were good but to pay around $8.50 for two small portioned tacos is not worth it at all! The restaurant itself was decorated nice but it was pretty hot inside. There was no working AC what so ever so it was pretty uncomfortable eating inside. It also took a while to finally get our food. If you\\'re looking for cheap authentic tacos/tortas I\\'d recommend going elsewhere. If prices lower its possible we\\'d be back to try them out again otherwise it\\'s just not worth paying that much for average food. I used to love soho pizza...BUT now I hate it!  read carefully please...this is a late night establishment and undoubtedly customers are inebriated or belligerent and wait in line.  fine. I, however, was none of the above...just a hungry surgery resident who wanted a slice of pizza.  well while standing in line the \"doorman\" tapped me on the shoulder and told me to stand against the wall. I stepped in that direction, but a ceiling light was at the same level as my head and I bumped into it.  I stepped away from the wall and was standing reviewing anatomy slides on my phone, and the bouncer told me to again stand against the wall l. I told him the light was in the way and that I couldn\\'t stand there because my head hits it and that I would have to crouch down to in order to stand against the wall.  he apparently took\\noffense to my explanation and threw me out!  they told me that I had to leave or I would be trespassing!  absolutely INSULTING! an arrogant worker can\\'t see the reasoning in my comment?  how can I stand against the wall when a hanging light is blocking my way?  I will NEVER eat at soho pizza!  NEVER!  mark my words and I have never been so humiliated and insulted!  i\\'ve been on call...woke up from crashing once i got home and wanted just a slice of pizza...one slice...I blame the management of this establishment for this mishap...shame on you for treating customers so poorly! Went here to get a cheesesteak but was extremely disappointed. The meat was very dry. Steak-umms are juicier than this meat. It was very bland tasting. The american cheese was not even melted just heated up. The fries were soggy and bland. The line moved quickly so I will give it two stars. I never get eating utensils with my order. I also will never order from this place again, the customer service was so rude I cancelled my order today. I was told after ordering 3 straight days that if I wanted to pay with a card I should order online (what establishment turns down service with dismissive attitudes?) honestly horrible customer service will lead many businesses to go belly up. Best of luck. Food was too salty for me.  The decor was nice, but the hostess seemed to be clueless.  We waited to get her attention for half an hour as she chatted with her co-workers.  And then we got seated at the bar since (supposedly) all the tables were reserved.  But we counted more than five tables open the 2 hours we were there.  I hated my dish, and my husband thought his was okay, but definitely not worth the price.  Neither of us will be returning to this restaurant considering there are so many other places to go. Can\\'t speak to the food here since the service was soooo bad I didn\\'t stick around to find out.    There is a convenience store that shares a space with the DD.   I wanted a newspaper and when I walked up to the DD counter and was told, \"over there.\"   So I paid for the paper at the convenience store cashier and went back to DD counter to get coffee.   I waited..... And waited...and waited.....as did the guy who was now in front of me while two people behind the counter couldn\\'t get their stuff together at 1:30 in the afternoon to pour a cup of coffee.   I left.   I gave the two stars only because I did not sample their food or coffee.....or but a paper from them. We have ordered take out from here several times in the last six months. They have gotten the order wrong every. Single. Time.\\n\\nOne time, we ordered a pasta seafood dish -- it arrived with NO PASTA in it!\\n\\nNext time we ordered a side of spinach and a side of pasta ( two separate sides). They arrived mixed together in a soupy mess.\\n\\nManagement did nothing to fix the obvious problems.\\n\\nWe will not be back Horrendous!!!!!  The most awful experience I ever had!  I wrote a review and it was taken down within a week.  I thought yelp was for the customers and businesses had no control over their input, now I\\'m not sure.  We were treated so badly by the owners for not ordering enough food.  Our waiter never informed us that we were supposed to order entrees for each person, probably because it does not state this on the menu.  Apparently pasta dishes do not count as a meal.  We were treated as if bringing bottles of wine into a byob is an obnoxious thing to do....oh only if you don\\'t order a meat course.  FYI not everyone eats meat! Either way I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone ever!! Unless you like to be abused. I ate here during restaurant week with associates that work at my firm. The food was excellent - well cooked steak and fish plates. Overall, everyone in my party of 7 was very satisfied. \\n\\nThe 3 star rating comes from the server\\'s lack of discretion at the end of the meal. I handed him my card to pay, and he came back about 5 minutes later and announced to the entire table that the card was declined. This was incredibly rude. I gave him another card. My associate watched him try to ring the second card up several times, until he was frustrated and tried a different machine. He came back several minutes later with the receipt for signing.\\n\\nIt was very clear that this was a machine issue, and not an issue with my card. Either way, the lack of discretion and rudeness really soured the meal, and it was an embarrassing situation to have occur in front of associates. I am not sure if I will return because of it, especially with my staff. We decided to stop here before going to the movies, we had a little over an hour and figured that would be plenty of time for a Pizzeria and Restaurant.  We were seated promptly, the restaurant was about 80% full.  We ordered drinks, and were very surprised to find out that our $2 soda was in fact a can of coke and a glass of ice.\\n\\nAs we waited to be able to place our order we noted a few things:\\n--- A 12 inch personal pizza ranges in price from $10 to $16, and although there are several options, you won\\'t find many traditional topping options, instead you find: hot dogs, eggplant, potatoes, capers and zucchini.  Additionally, if you want to share your generously sized 12 inch pizza you will be charged an additional $5 share charge!\\n--- The table next to us had a complaint about their food, that review is also her on Yelp. From what we witnessed the management had no interest in making the situation right.\\n--- Another family had waited so long they got up and told the staff they needed to pay and leave, because their food was not yet ready.\\n---- A table being apologized to, because there was a very long delay in getting their food.\\n\\nAfter waiting over 15 minutes, and our order not being taken,  We decided it was best to seek another option and make sure we made it to our movie.  Luckily Wendy\\'s and WaWa are convenient for our now much shorter time before the movie.\\n\\nIf you are looking for an Italian meal, I would highly encourage you to check out another location.   Perhaps Vince & Tony\\'s or Piazza Presto. Went today for lunch. Had the salmon burger. Absolutely terrible. It tasted frozen!!!  Our waiter was very nice, so that helped some. Stay far away from the salmon burger. You have been warned!! I won\\'t be eating here again. The sandwich was okay, definitely not worth the nine bucks, but what really turned me off was the cashier. I ordered my sandwich and asked for a cup of regular water. She asked if seltzer was okay and I said \"no thanks, just tap\". She said \"oh, a water bottle then.\" I said \"oh. That\\'s okay, never mind.\" After I paid and waited right there for the sandwich, I asked if she had ketchup or a dipping condiment. She said yes, but we charge for it because its specially made. I asked how much, and since I\\'d already paid said \"oh well, thank you anyway\". I continued to wait- while the cashier walked over to one coworker to mutter and stare at me...then walked to the OTHER side of the stand to tell another coworker assumedly how ridiculous I was for asking for a free condiment? They were staring right at me. It was really uncomfortable. I couldn\\'t shake that off as this lady was right in front of me helping others until I got my sandwich and left. In the future, I will be going back to other stands in Reading Terminal, where the workers don\\'t make customers feel like shit while they\\'re STILL STANDING THERE. Blah Blah Blah Amada Amada Amada. \\n\\nNothing was bad, everything was ok, but Chifa is better. \\n\\nOur service was impeccable. \\n\\nGarlic Shrimp were over salted. \\n\\nWon\\'t be going back for a while. Too man other, cheaper, better places. It must have been my unlucky day to go to John\\'s.  Right across the street is a large chemical plant.  During my visit, the noxious fumes were quite awful.  Two hours later, I still have a headache.  I looked for a name on the chemical plant, but it is apparently anonymous.\\n\\nIf you want some of their food, get takeout and maybe even send someone else to pick it up.  The food may be good, but I won\\'t take the chance of being exposed to the fumes. Horrible experience! We ordered classic margaritas and when they came they were gone with one sip. $9.00 margaritas that are tiny and a waste of money. Our waiter dropped a bowl of salsa it shattered and hit our legs and pants. I ordered enchiladas and they had no flavor, absolutely none! So disappointed after hearing good things about this restaurant. Needless to say we will not be returning. If I could give zero stars, I would. My family and I have had multiple bad experiences here, but I always like to give restaurants the benefit of the doubt since I used to work in the restaurant industry. But nope. Yesterday was our very last visit there. Service was horrible, and depending where you sit (if you sit furthest away from salad bar) the gauchos will never come to visit your table. It\\'s unfortunate because I have complained the the female manager there before and although she was sweet and gave my family a giftcard to come back, it\\'s still the same. Nothing has improved and it\\'s still poor service for the amount of $ you spend. Can\\'t say much:  was seated, no one came to serve me after ten minutes, so I left.  Went down the road to a finer establishment.  Maybe I will try this place again, but I doubt it.  Service was poor and decor is lack luster. Title: The Water Was Good\\nI have been to the Solaris Grille several times, and each time, we hoped the food would improve. The decor is pleasant, and as I read in another review, it\\'s true: you just want the food to be good. The restaurant is close to our house, and the outdoor seating is helpful, as we have a toddler. Each time we went, the food was worse than the previous visit. The vegetarian platter was full of grease: the spring rolls had nothing inside them, the fritters could nearly be wrung out from the grease, there was tasteless hummus with four chips, and I am not exactly sure what else appeared on my husband\\'s plate. I had the Maryland crab chowder and it was actually spicy and tasteless at the same time. I sent it back. The coconut shrimp were just OK, or maybe it was the mustard sauce that saved them. We have also ordered the tuna in the past, I can\\'t describe the taste but it was not good. The nachos are always limp and below average, at best. Service, every time we go, is ridiculously slow. Should it take 45 minutes to get a drink? The place was not full at all. There were three other tables, including ours. At least the waitress was pleasant. We will never, ever return. My husband cooks way better food than this overpriced slop. Went against the grain and got a BLT on sesame bread. Nothing fancy as they literally grilled a few bacon strips, added some lettuce leaves and tomato slices. The bread isn\\'t toasted or anything and they cut off the ends. It was good but I don\\'t think it was worth almost $10.\\n\\nThe staff works really fast and efficiently though and the line of customers was never ending. I came early around 10am so the wait was about 10 minutes.\\n\\nMost people ordered the cheese steak which was a frozen slab of meat chopped think and mixed with some cheese and peppers. No fuss or frills. HORRIBLE LUNCH!\\n\\nI do not eat meat and they refused to substitute anything for me!  They told me in order to do so I would have to order from the dinner menu which I was handed.  Then the waiter told me that I still had to pay extra for the substitution!  \\n\\nWho the hell ever heard of chicken fried rice anyway??!!  GROSS!  They should just serve basic fried rice then everyone is happy. Dear Chapterhouse, when I was there recently, a man that I sat next to me was licking his chocolate milk from his cup without using his hands and fondling his genitals over his pants constantly.  This was in the middle room/area with the smaller tables.  I have seen this man, who is about 5\\'6, dark hair, wearing headphones, and have noticed him at your coffee shop before.  I have never sat next to him.  This experience disturbed me quite a bit and I will not be returning to your coffee shop, at least not by myself ever again because as a young woman, I did not feel safe.  This is a shame because this used to be a great place to study. I just left this place. It\\'s beer week and happy hour, so I understand that it\\'s going to be really crowded, but service is really slow.  It\\'s so slow that I waited at the bar for about 20 minutes and not one bartender even acknowledged me. We resorted to waving our hands to get their attention, but they really didn\\'t look up much.  We were able to get a table, and it was the same result. In about 15 minutes not one waitress came up to our table. Plenty walked by. Giving this place 2 stars because the girl at the front was somewhat nice, so it wasn\\'t a completely horrible experience. Im so very disappointed. I\\'ve been comming here for a long time and over the years the service has declined.  To me they still served the best and freshest salads so I continued to patronize but tonight was the absolute last straw. After picking up my order and getting it home I opened my salad and first thing I noticed was my eggs on my Grilled chicken Ceasar salad looked half eaten! Literally bit, teeth marks and all! I had 7 huge pieces of chicken that weren\\'t cooked thoroughly or chopped. It looked like someone started eating it then sent it back and they sold it to me! I called to speak to the manager and the girl who answered was very rude and nasty and kept insisting no one was there for me to talk to and told me to wait on hold till someone was available wich she said was gonna be long because the managerleft out. A simple apology and explanation would have been ok because we all make mistakes even tho this was one of the nastiest things I can recall ever happening to me with a food order. Just goes to show the level of professionalism and customer service and food safety has definitely gone down the drain when something like this happens at a restaurant like this I got their \"everything in the garden\" salad, or something like that.  For $11, I could have walked over to Whole Foods and purchased all the ingredients myself to make multiple salads at that cost.  The sweet balsamic dressing had a very watery texture.  I\\'m glad vegans are happy, but I guess I expected more for a $12 salad. I think this restaurant is highly over rated and characteristic of a restaurant taking advantage of the wealth of the mainline. I have only been for lunch but Most of the courses I have had including sandwiches,  salads and soup are bland,  contain very little fresh ingredients other than kale and are incredibly expensive.  11 dollars for a chopped garden salad? 6 for sweet potato fries? Equally disappointing was the dessert,  which was over cooked and crispy and the service which was inattentive and pretentious.  Save your money. Unfortunately I\\'ll continue to go here as several of my colleagues insist on it; so maybe it\\'s me... been here twice now and i do not know why i gave it a second chance. same issue as the first time. THEY SKIMP ON THE FISH! no other place in the city puts cucumber in spicy tuna rolls. do not want it in there. get it out and give me more tuna. charge me more, i don\\'t care if its a few bucks more (price was too low to start) at least then im not disappointed and hungry. Revising my review from tonight\\'s recent take out order. I should\\'ve known when I couldn\\'t get through on the phone to just go somewhere else. Tried multiple times calling and pressing 2 for take out and no one answered each time. Finally got a hold of someone by pressing button for call ahead. Placed order, arrived and the area they have for take out they do not use obviously. You have to go to the crowded packed bar with 1 swamped bartender. Waited at least 5 mins to even be acknowledged. Another 5 to get food. Food horrible, ice cold, just bad. Boneless wings inedible. Go somewhere else and more convenient next time because even when calling ahead to place a to go order it will not be a quick easy transaction. So I had to give this restaurant a star or it would not let me post this review. I have never eaten here because when I called on a Sunday to make reservations on a Monday the woman on the phone asked me if I had a groupon which I said I did and she said no no no no groupons one Sunday and I told her mayb she should have put that on the groupon then she started yelling at me because I said that ( I am not making this up) the groupon only states that it could not be used on a federal holiday unless April 12th is some kind of federal holiday which I am not aware of anyway I explain that I was calling to make reservations for Monday again she yells no no no we r not open on Monday I then explained that I was looking at there website which states that they r open Monday and again she starts yelling at me again ...so I tell her I will come in on Tuesday @7 pm two seconds later she calls me back yelling again that I gave her two different times at this point I\\'m like no way will I go to this place if she treated me so bad on the phone I can only imagine what she would do to my food ....actually it is kinda of funny I mean if ur in the hospitality industry shouldn\\'t u b hospitable???? Oh well save ur self a trip go to a place that wants ur business It\\'s extremely hard to mess up breakfast yet O\\'Grady\\'s very successfully manages to do so!  \\n\\nAfter waiting 35 minutes to be waited on only as I was about to leave did the waitress decide she should approach me and take my order! \\n\\nThe breakfast buffet was absolutely gross, disgusting and not fit for human consumption!  Sausages sitting in warm tap water, other items weren\\'t refilled until I was about to leave!\\n\\nAt 9:30 items were old, dried out, and ice cold truly unappealing so I ordered an omelette.  Over cooked served with lukewarm barely toasted bread and something that was supposed to be hash browns truly terrible .  \\n\\nThe waitress left the check with the omelette and never came back to refill beverage or ask if I needed anything .   My advice.. go to Wawa it\\'s a whole lot cheaper, the food is hot and fresh and chances are the cashier will be a lot friendlier and customer oriented! Interesting and creative toppings, but overall very disappointing.  Pizza was warm, not hot and not filling at all... you\\'ll need 3-4 slices minimum to curb your hunger.  I won\\'t be back... Horrible.  They will not serve you a drink.  Horrible service, just avoid it.  They make money here, its obvious, I don\\'t know why... they shouldn\\'t. Insanely overpriced.  A society that accepts minuscule cupcakes for $3.50 is a society that is destined for collapse.\\n\\nThe cookie sandwiches were delicious though. Got takeout last night trying to help local businesses during this crazy time.  We were extremely disappointed with our meal.  The salad was brown, the pizza lacked topping and was really doughy.  It will be awhile before we decide to go Nothing special. People compare this place to Five guys and I would say that comparison is not even close. These burgers are just ok. I had a restaurant.com voucher which is why I came here. I wouldn\\'t return without one because it\\'s not worth it. I was here for formal last night and they messed up checking IDs. Everyone over 21 was supposed to get a wristband to be permitted on the lower floor for drinks. Most people over 21 didn\\'t get their wristband and then had to wait close to an hour to get them. The crew and staff did nothing to make up for their mistake. The food was nothing to brag about and the drinks were way over priced. Nearly $10 for a small vodka soda. \\n\\nBetter luck with any other company. Sushi is bland... maybe it was a bad day. \\n\\nTheir drinks are pretty expensive. \\n\\nI would probably come back if I was with a group of drunken friends looking for a quick fix. Brief update: The restaurant contacted me this morning, profusely apologizing for our experience and requesting an opportunity to  make it right.  For this I give them a lot of credit. They attributed what happened to the fact that they were VERY busy last night.  Good restaurants should be good at being busy!! But I am more than happy to give it another go.  Hopefully this really was an exception.  Will update the review after the next visit.\\n\\nI really wish I could write a better review...but I cant.\\nVery straightforward...\\nDid a large take out order.\\nThe salad was bagged lettuce mix with a generic carrot ginger miso dressing.\\nThe miso soup literally tasted like dishwater.\\nThere was a foreign object in the Udon (melted plastic).\\nThe sushi was good.  Not great.  But there are so many other places nearby with sushi that is as good or better, there really is no reason to rush here.\\nI really wish it could have been different, as I love having new places to frequent.  This wont be one of them. It was just OK....food was not great and service wasn\\'t either. Not worth the price.\\nDisappointed as we went to celebrate Valentine\\'s weekend. BEWARE: check your credit card statement once it clears. They took out an extra tip for themselves - not what I authorized or signed off on. Food is good, but I could do without the stealing. Very disappointing. Nothing especially Greek on the menu except Moussaka. Waitress said the owner took most of the authentic Greek dishes off the menu.The so-called Greek chicken pot pie tasted like it came from a can. The only thing Greek about it was a phyllo dough topping. The portion size was quite small. I couldn\\'t imagine any reason to ever come back. Too bad Philly doesn\\'t have a \"Greektown\" like Chicago and Baltimore. I used to like this place until I started getting food delivered to my house. For some reason the price would be different when they arrived to my home. And the price would be really high. My final straw was when they delivered food that was dry and when I tried to call back to let them know, the lady on the phone says to me she wants to send the driver back so he can look at the food. I mean I\\'m suppose to let some driver look at my food and then what? She was rude and disrespectful, I will never order any food from them ever again. I have been meaning to update my last review so here it is. We\\'ve been here 3 times since mother\\'s day and the food and service have been impeccable! So I guess mother\\'s day is just not the day to go... La Colombe has great product, but unless you\\'re taking it home to brew yourself then don\\'t waste your money. THEIR BARISTAS SUCK SO BAD- I\\'d be shocked to learn that they spend more than an hour training new employees. They\\'re slow, with no customer focus. If you order anything from the bar (hot chocolate, latte, cappuccino) they\\'ll steam your milk to room temperature and try pass it off as \"extra hot.\" Even when I order extra hot drinks, they still come to me lukewarm. And if I ask for it to be remade extra hot, I get dirty looks like I\\'m the devil for asking for what I ordered. They are unwelcoming, rude and horrible. I won\\'t be coming back, especially with Reanimator and Steap and Grind both a short walk away. Good luck, La Colombe! I couldn\\'t agree more with D.C. and this is also my first post on Yelp.  I wanted to love it.  I loved Joey\\'s and Frankie the K\\'s.  However, the inside of the place has been stripped of all charm since the change in management and looks very tired and worn.  We were told by a young kid that we couldn\\'t put an order in for five minutes as he was busy preparing the order for the two people who were the only other people in the place.  After ten minutes, a woman came in who seemed to take over behind the counter and took our order.  Rather than coming to our table where we had been patiently waiting for ten minutes, she had us get up and come to the register.  No big deal, but there was no apology, explanation or friendly conversation of any kind.  She proceeded to make the order while the kid yawned and checked his text messages.  Eventually, the order was delivered to the table and was definitely not worth the wait and lack of service.  In particular, my cheese hoagie, which has been packed full of cheese under the previous management, was basically a vegetable hoagie with a few thin slices of cheese.  The LJ and chicken hoagies were sparsely filled and also hugely disappointing.  The cheese whiz made the fries inedible.  Like D.C. it was a miserable experience, though not quick in our case.   I get that it is a new business and they need to keep overhead down, but you also need repeat customers. I ate here last night and while my meal was very good, I was very disappointed in how they handled a poorly cooked lobster and cold dinner one of my friends was served.  First, in a well run restaurant a manager should come by and ask you how everything was but that never happened and we were a very large party.  Second, when my friend told the server her lobster was over cooked and her whole meal was cold, including her uneaten potatoes, the server rolled her eyes and did nothing for her.  This lets me know they don\\'t really care about the customers.  For the kind of money you spend here, I expect better service than this. It\\'s May 20th 2012 and I just left Butcher and Singer where I joined a group of 12 for a bachelor weekend dinner.  I found the lighting inside this establishment absolutely dismal.  I really don\\'t see the point of making a restaurant so dark.  I had looked at the menu on line prior to arriving.  Good thing I did, too, because I would never have been able to read it otherwise.  I thought the food was of acceptable quality but thought is was way overpriced.  A dinner that would have cost about $50-$60 per person (including beverages) in any upscale Philadelphia restaurant wound up costing almost $90 per person.  I particularly did not like the server\\'s habit of touching me to get my attention.  I could have done without that.  The piped-in music was entirely too loud, so beside barely being able to see my dinner companions, I could barely hear them as well.  For me, the food at Butcher and Singer was a \"take it or leave it\" dining experience.  But the noisy, dark atmosphere and the \"touchy-feely\" wait staff definitely made me glad to leave it and get outside. I went here last night with my mom and girlfriend and it sucked. The waitress seemed like she was high, she kept forgetting everything. When she brought our entrees she didnt even try and clear the table from our appitizer and our salad, she just left all the dishes on our crowded table. The fish that i got was dry and overcooked, and the fettuccine alfredo that my girlfriend got was bland and tasteless. We also got an appetizer that was cheese \"fondue\" and it was disgusting, just a bunch of greasy melted cheese in a bowl with bread. It was very disappointing, olive garden sucks! I have been a reluctant patron of this diner because of its convenient location to my house but the last few times I have been there I have been extremely disappointed not with the service but with the cleanliness, food and the management. Sitting at the table this last experience I should have taken the hint as the table had gnats on it. Not the first time I have seen bugs. The waitress wipes the table and apologized. I ordered and when I went to finish my coffee I found gnats in my cup. Gross is an understatement... after the food was subpar, sausage  not cooked thoroughly and the gnats - the waitress knowing I am a repeat customer attempted to make ammends only to be told by the owner/chef that he did not care and would only discount my drink. (I heard him say he did not care) Needless to say based on my previous experiences and this last bug infested meal, I will NOT be going back and will be reporting this establishment to the health department. My one star is for the waitresses... Their phone is disconnected (same number on their site and Yelp). \\nEdit: Apparently they are no longer in business. :( Its been a while since I came here, but I went for brunch this past weekend and got really terrible service. When we first walked in the hostess was sitting down and took her time to get up to seat. \\n\\nOnce we got a table we were greeted by our waitress Diane. Major attitude, was sitting at the bar most of the time while we were there. Took forever to take our order. Never checked back on us after we got our food. Couldn\\'t get a water or coffee refill. When we were ready for the check it had started to get a little busy and she kept glancing over at our table, but still took forever to come and drop off the check. Didn\\'t even ask how things were.\\n\\nThey were out of a lot of stuff too like the hummus and gluten free buns.\\n\\nFood was descent, but probably won\\'t be back because of the terrible service. If you prefer horrible customer service, this is your place. After driving around the block several times to try to find somewhere to park, I finally edged my way into a metered spot. $.25 for 15 minutes, figured that would be good. \\nI didn\\'t realize what I had in store for me. I had three people in front of me dealing with a cashier with obvious language barriers. After about 20 minutes, I finally got to order and was greeted. 30 minutes later I had the correct order after being given the wrong one twice. No apology was of course offered. The \"gentleman\" even seemed annoyed that I wanted to get what I actually ordered. Unfortunately, this experience took the better part of 30 minutes and I had a parking ticket waiting for me when I got to my car.\\nFor my money, dunkin donuts is two blocks away, has free off street parking, is cheaper, better, and faster. Stay away from country bagel, unless you have a lot of time, don\\'t want to get what you ordered, and like paying fines. Don\\'t go here if you like Indian food. Everything I had was either too watered down or too dry and over or under seasoned.  Pretty disappointing. I stopped in here with a friend for dinner tonight for the first time. There is a sign coming in that says please wait to be seated, we waited 10 minutes before we even saw anyone who worked here. We were seated in the back corner which we didn\\'t mind. We ordered drinks, which we didn\\'t receive for at least 20 minutes. At the point that our drinks were finally brought to us we said thankyou and our waitress didn\\'t even acknowledge us, she just walked away WITHOUT asking if we were ready to order.  She finally came back after 5 more minutes and took or order that she didn\\'t write down, which I usually don\\'t mind but she had to come back twice to double check and ask what we ordered again.  When we finally got our food the order was wrong. I had asked for a chicken quesadilla without salsa, it not only had salsa but when I told the waitress it was wrong she proceeded to argue with me and tell me that I didn\\'t order what I said I ordered.. I am writing this review as I am sitting here still waiting for my correct order. Although the drinks tasted good, I will never be coming back here due to the AWFUL service. Awful! I walked in and was told, if I want to order food, to seat myself. I waited half an hour without getting service. When I finally ordered, the server goes, \"That\\'s it?\", brought me an iced coffee in a to go cup with no cream or sugar along with it, and a bagel wrapped in foil in a to-go bag... And then, of course, I had to pay at the register. Might I add that people all around me had food on ACTUAL PLATES with silverware. Somehow, I was categorized in the no service, eye rolling, no cream or sugar class of patrons. \\nI miss Milkboy. We were excited to see Mediterranean food in our area (rare). They did a popup restaurant in King of Prussia so several coworkers went there today. The Falafel was not fresh and very dry. Most likely made last night. The hummus was runny, not the way I like mine. I hope the actual restaurant is much better but I thought the whole concept of a popup restaurant was to showcase your food and would have been the best of the best of the food items. Meh! Went out for dinner last night. Nice ambiance and good service. Had the swordfish steak with broccoli and mashed potato, and my girlfriend had the almond-crusted salmon. Hers was nice but nothing too special. Mine, however, was not that great and pretty bland, and I found a hair in my broccoli. They apologized and gave me another side of broccoli (but claimed it\\'s corn hair since they cook it with broccoli but I\\'m sure it was not). When the bill came they didn\\'t even give us the courtesy of a discount or a free dessert for the mishap in my dish. After we paid I called the manager and told him that we weren\\'t happy with how the matter was handled. Like a dear in the headlights, the seemingly inexperienced manager offered a discount but I told him no thanks, we didn\\'t want it as an afterthought. Don\\'t think we\\'ll go back. There are a lot of better options in an area like KOP. Not impressed.  To begin with, I\\'ve received better service at McDonald\\'s. Our waiter was nice enough, but not very attentive and certainly not sophisticated enough to work at a restaurant like Devon which touts itself as \\'high end\\' (ha!). I won\\'t give examples at the risk of sounding like a snotty bitch. (But hey, it was still a $120 bill- I\\'m entitled to have expectations, right?) \\n\\nAnyway, quite surprisingly, we had three flies that kept circling around our table. We asked to be moved and the manager\\'s only excuse was \"well... it\\'s not just your table, it\\'s the whole restaurant.\" ....... okay..... We moved to another table. It was slightly better.\\n\\nDishes were practically thrown on our table as the \\'runners\\' lived up to their name.\\n\\nThe food was good. Not great, but good. I had the crab cakes and they had good flavor and were mostly crab. Pretty small and not the most extraordinary I\\'ve ever had, but I ate the whole thing. The wrong dessert was brought out but somewhat quickly replaced. There was a mix up with the bill and my boyfriend finally had to get up himself and physically find our waiter. \\n\\nI left certain of two things: 1. Restaurant week aint all it\\'s cracked up to be. 2. I will never go back to Devon... This isn\\'t Philly\\'s best. Pretty disappointing - this place use to have average sushi selections but now is unacceptable to eat in my opinion.  More than half the sushi/sashimi looks almost expired and has a very fishy taste.  Even most of the non sushi items were over cooked and dry.  The hibachi grill was subpar.  Only the udon station and desserts were acceptable.  It\\'s a bummer I use to go to this place for group dinners since it originally opened but now I wont recommend this place to my friends/family unless they change their quality of food esp for the price you pay. The atmosphere was nice, not amazing.  The stone walls and candle light were a nice touch, however, our table appeared to be the only one in the room without a candle.  I ordered the trout special. Bite one: amazing.  Bite 2: RAW.  The fish was completely undercooked, cold, slimy, and disturbing.  The waitress apologized and said a new plate would be coming out right away.  45 minutes later, after my friends had long since finished their meals, I was no longer hungry but got my food anyway.  The beverage service was very slow as well.  They only charged me half price for my meal. Came during restaurant week. Restaurant was packed which I thought was a good sign. However, the food was not memorable at all. Bland and dry. Would be willing to try on a different night. The first time I came here I left with a bad impression but I wanted to give it another chance today and  the same thing happen again I was disappoint again. I came in a group of 5 we asked for churros first and they came after one hour later only because we ask if they were coming out. The food came out at different times. One of the food came out way before all the other food came and we ask if they could keep it in the kitchen until the other food comes and they toke it back and they brought it cold and they toke it out and reheated it. I just wish they can improve because I would like to come back to this place and I hope to come soon Such a disappointment.  While our waitress was friendly, she was slow and very inexperienced accommodating allergies.  Although we were assured my daughter\\'s burger was safe...she had a reaction.  Should have left when she came back and said the \"pancakes have egg yolk in the flour, but the chef won\\'t add an egg...so she should be fine\".  I was shocked at this experience in 2017. Beware...Not allergy friendly! Used the delivery option, my order had some simple requests (add onion etc) that were ignored and I didn\\'t receive my side orders at all. The food was average and the restaurant didn\\'t want to refund me for the missing item (?) luckily Yelp refunded me on their behalf. I wouldn\\'t recommend for delivery. Worst buffalo wild wings by far. The service is never able to help or ever around. The management in this location is always hiding in the kitchen and never wants to admit to the waste of a staff they have working here. I came here for dinner with friends, and it was not a great experience.  \\n\\nParking was a hassle, which is by no means a fault of the restaurant, but it was annoying to have to circle around the area for about 15 minutes before we got lucky with an open space in the small parking lot in the back. \\n\\nThe food was terrible. Our pizzas looked and tasted like a cheap frozen pizza we would buy at the grocery store. The nachos we split as a table were bland. My friend said her pulled pork sandwich was dry and didn\\'t even finish it. Definitely overpriced and not worth it.\\n\\nI do have to say, the beer was good. They had a nice selection of seasonal and standard beers, and we were able to get a few samples to try them out before we ordered. I thought it was reasonably priced, too. \\n\\nCome for drinks, but not for a meal. Negative Review Time......\\n\\nI came to Philly with high expectations. I wanted to experience the hype and I was disappointed. Maybe Philadelphia is ignorant for thinking that they have the best cheesesteaks or maybe I was at the wrong place.\\n\\nI have always been told to go to Pat\\'s, Geno\\'s, or John\\'s Roast Pork, but we stayed at the Four Points Sheraton and the locals told us to go to Carmen\\'s. I thought trusting the locals was a wise decision. \\n\\nWe waited in line for a very long time with only 5 or 6 people ahead of us. We ordered one with the wiz and one with provolone. I thought the provolone tasted much better than the wiz.\\n\\nThe bread was very bulky and hard (did not taste very fresh) and the meat was just ok..........very bland.......I don\\'t even think that they used any seasoning........ It was not a bad sandwich....I would eat one again, but it just didn\\'t live up to the hype....... I think it\\'s safe to say that D\\'angelo\\'s makes a better cheesesteak. Sorry Philly...... tl;dr - food is fine, service stinks. if you have a Longhorn nearby at a similar distance, there\\'s no point in going to Texas Roadhouse. \\n\\nI used to go TR from time to time when I was younger with my family, but for no particular reason, I had a several-year hiatus from the place. one night a friend and I were going to get dinner but wanted to do something different. I suggested TR, instead of one of our usual spots, Longhorn. it was a mistake. \\n\\nwe walked in and were sat immediately. it was a Friday, but it was kind of later, and there was only two of us. after we were sat in a section that only had one way in and out, we were passed by two different servers. neither took our drinks. finally, a girl came to take our drinks. it was odd though; where we were sitting was split between two servers, but just me and my friend were being served by this one girl. almost as if she was assigned to another section, and taking care of us, as well. \\n\\nafter she brought the drinks, we ordered, and that was the last time we saw our waitress until after we finished eating. she did not come by to check on us while we were eating, and I needed to ask one of the waiters actually working in our section for a refill. I HATE doing that because I understand servers can be busy and don\\'t want to be \"that guy.\" \\n\\nafter we ate, our waitress came back and asked us how everything was. I said something to the effect of \"luckily it was good. long time, no see.\" she kind of laughed, but did not apologize. after we got the check we both agreed the food was good, but there\\'s no point to ever choose TR of Longhorn. I will not be coming back. Besito has many great things to offer its customers, unfortunately a great meal is not one of them. The decor and ambience is inviting and enjoyable. However the quality of the fish and chicken left a lot to desired. My initial dish, \"the rock fish special\", came out looking less than appetizing. The fish was not fresh and tasted horrible. My second dish was a salad with grilled chicken. The chicken was rubbery and inedible. After that I decided to enjoy a liquid dinner (consisting of vodka). Our waitress was very nice and attentive, but food was no beuno. They gave us a traditional worry doll, however all I am worrying about is whether or not I get food poisoning. Long line always in the take out window.  Finally get up to the window, order my coffee and ask for a carrier.  They charged me $1.00 extra for the carrier- what?  No wonder they consistently get bad reviews for service. So My now husband introduced me to this place almost 7 years ago. Love the steaks and tuna hoagie. Yesterday I decided for Sunday Dinner that we were going to have Cheese steaks and Hoagies. I was the first customer in at noon so I could drive an hour back home to meet my family. Everything tasted good. About an hour and half in, my niece got sick, later that evening my husband got sick, around midnight I got sick and my sister told me this morning she couldn\\'t stay out of the bathroom. I don\\'t know weather they gave us bad/old meat or what, but unfortunately never again. Done with Docs. Yes it was the only bad experience, but certainly the worse when my whole family is sick. I hate to leave a bad review but, the food here was AWFUL. I had crab stuffed flounder; very strong fish flavor from a mild white fish. My friend had chicken marsala; flavorless \\'glop\\' of a gravey. \\nTo end on a positive note; the service was great and I had a decent gin martini. I wanted to give 5 stars but couldn\\'t because of our last visit.  I have always had great experiences and have always loved Texas.  Especially their rolls and butter.  But our last visit has me questioning whether or not to return.    We got to our table and two of our roll plates were a bit dirty so we requested the host to grab us new ones. After receiving new plates My son commented how he needs another new one.  I responded that maybe they aren\\'t dirty and it\\'s just worn.  He says \"no mom, I need a new one\" and shows it to me.  The plate had dried steak sauce or something all over the bottom. We again asked for a new plate and our waitress handed us one of the first plates that we returned.  Ummm....gross. I commented how they were the originals we got rid of and she just responded that she didn\\'t take the originals from us.  That\\'s not the point, my point was that dirty dishes were not returned to the kitchen. They were put back for other customers to use.  What if we had done something gross to those plates?  \\nUnfortunately our experience didn\\'t improve.  I got one of my sides before my meal which didn\\'t make sense since it was a side not an appetizer.  Then I didn\\'t even get my vegetables with my meal, I had to ask for them. The service was so so. This used to be one of my favorites but it seems to be going downhill which is unfortunate. I usually go around 430pm and don\\'t have any issues but this last time didn\\'t work out in our favor. I began ordering a burger and told the server \"medium.\"  He replied we only cook them medium-well, it\\'s how we do all of our burgers.  Huh, seriously?  What kind of restaurant ONLY cooks to one temperature.  I\\'ve heard restaurants not cooking certain meats rare or medium-rare but that\\'s due to customers possibly getting sick.  I really wanted to try a particular burger but because of their stupid \"only medium-well\" temp rule, I immediately changed my order to a chicken sandwich because if that cook leaves the burger on a few seconds too late, it\\'s ruined.  Thanks to \"medium-well only\" a half dozen items on the menu were off now limits.  Note to kitchen manager--enough of this silly procedure, allow the customers to order their burger how they want it. So sad...we have lived here 13 years and this has been our go to place. My daughter knows everyone by name and greets them with excitement. We called for a pizza tonight, they knew it was us and said we were \"10 minutes too late\". Happy Holidays...we\\'ll never be back. Food is average, the service is terrible. With so many choices in town, no way would I go back. We were the only customers in here at dinner time on a Thursday night, and it took us 2hrs mins to come and go with only 1 cocktail, apps & dinner. It seems like the managers and wait staff are a bunch of friends who would rather chat than serve the customers. I\\'m surprised this place is still open. I am actually at Deterra right now. I have been sitting at a high top table in the bar for 25 minutes. I have yet to get a correct drink order. So sad that one person is working the area and three people are standing at the hostess stand doing nothing. I rarely write reviews, unless a place is so great it deserves attention. In this case, i am still upset about my experience over 24 hours later. A friend and I hopped off the speed line in route to a show last night. It was raining so we popped into the first place we saw for a drink and light food. The bartender was immediately abrupt and rude, we both noticed but proceeded to order anyway. The drinks were unique, so we asked a few questions...he seemed annoyed at that. I ordered a cocktail drink that was described as apple cider with a hint of smoke. Sounded good for a fall night in Philly. When i received and tried it, the smoke flavor was overwhelming, like sticking your head in the smoke from a bonfire. I was hesitant to let the bartender know, but honestly couldn\\'t stomach it. I acknowledged that he said it had a smoke flavor and recognized that I chose it, then asked to switch it for something else. The bartender actually said \"the problem here is I can\\'t put it back in the bottle.\" I was stunned, he was serious, I\\'m honestly still shocked. I wasn\\'t rude, didn\\'t say he did a bad job, the drink was simply not good to me. In all my life I\\'ve never experienced such rude behavior, He should have gladly switched it out, no question. I worked in the restaurant business for many years, i\\'m quite aware of the etiquette. Needless to say, we couldn\\'t wait to leave and will never be back. It\\'s too bad b/c the place is right around the corner from the theaters on Broad street. I wish the owner knew who represented the business, i\\'m sure it would not be tolerated. We enjoy Arby\\'s sandwich\\'s but stoped patronizing this location because we felt they were shorting the meat when ordering more than one sandwich. We contacted management and the sworn we were wrong. We decided to give them another try because they are a local business. You that saying never go back! Well I would appreciate some one from Arby\\'s to identify this sandwich? It\\'s supposed to be a half pounder roast-beef! It\\'s 2am, the bar has closed, and it\\'s a choose your own adventure situation. You can either:\\n\\n1) Watch amateur strippers @ The Republican. Note: the girls are gross and it\\'s very smokey.\\n\\n2) Eat a western omelet at Midtown Diner.\\n\\n3) Join the sausage party at Ruba Hall. Note: the old man owner gets really grumpy at 330.\\n\\n4) Join the shirtless gay men at Vouyer for a continued dance party.\\n\\nMy selection varies depending on the night, but this past Friday when I checked out the Making Time party at Vouyer, I was met with a floor full of people just as enthusiastic as I was when the DJ transitioned from MGMT\\'s \"Kids\" to The Waitresses\\' \"Christmas Wrapping.\" \\n\\nImagine my excitement when I got to publicly cut a rug to music that\\'s typically reserved for weekday nights spent practicing dance moves to a disengaged mirror. ****** UPDATE: I have tried to order food three times in the last two weeks and I have been told every time that Desert Rose was closing early (over an hour and a half early!) because they ran out of food!! :( this is very unprofessional and makes me sad. PLEASE GET YOUR FOOD ORDERS TOGETHER because you have several very unhappy customers in this household :( ********* The service was great! But the food was just okay. Cold unseasoned parm fries, and greasy huevos were a huge let down. The huevos also has potatoes in it for some reason, but that isn\\'t listed on the menu. It\\'s not a great addition and I wouldn\\'t have ordered the dish had I known there were potatoes included. This is not a breakfast spot I\\'d return to for the price, when there\\'s so many other price comparable places in the area with much better food. Sabrina\\'s food seems like microwaved sysco food. I went back to give it a fair shot. Any locals say this place is good shiuld be ashamed of themselves.  I got the cheesesteak and a side if meatballs. The steak was god awful. The meat was flavor less so the dump a bunch of nasty cheeze sauce... ( not american, not wiz) on it and put garlic butter on the roll.\\nI would rate it just below a hot pocket. \\nThe meatballs were the same the meat was flavorless. The sauce wasnt horrible, buy all in all iy was a bad experience.  I will not be going back..ever.\\nIf i want an authentic cheesesteak i will go to one of many mom and pop places in the neighborhood.  This place actually offends me. have eaten here twice both times made me sick! And staff is very Rude never again Was directed to stand by the crowded bar and told a waiter would help us out. Waited far too long for two drinks. Eventually got a seat and our drinks. Legitimately think they forgot the gin and served straight sweet vermouth. Overall let down since the ambience and reviews were so great. I hate to give the Tower 1 star. It\\'s a legendary venue, but it seems it is being destroyed by the current management. The people that work there seem very unhappy. Their attitudes range from indifferent to downright hostile, especially Security. No one seems to be in charge and no one is able or willing to answer the simplest of questions. To spend that kind of money to see a show and receive that kind of treatment is infuriating.\\n\\nI was there for a show recently and, in fairness, I\\'m not sure how much of the following was the fault of the artist and how much was down to the venue. The headliner did not come out for over 2 hours after the opener. There was not explanation given. The sound was terrible. There was feedback happening well into the show. The artist had to give instructions to the sound engineer from the stage. The kick drum had no low end in it for the first few songs. It was all very unprofessional.\\n\\nI won\\'t go to a show here again unless someone is performing there that I absolutely must see or the management changes. Haven\\'t been to the Bourse since the update.  I was walking past and decided to walk through.  Interesting selection of craft beers so I stopped by for a quick pour.  I didn\\'t have time to hang so I just wanted a quick taste.  Bartender seemed friendly and I ordered a simple 4oz pour.  Bartender walks away and nothing.  A few minutes later a group comes in all ordering flights.  I was completely ignored.  I even waited a few more minutes but nothing.  If you don\\'t do 4oz pours why is it on the menu?  I had to go.  Lame!\\n\\nTons of other places in the neighborhood where me and my simple order won\\'t be ignored.  And my friends and I will have more time. I have ordered from here plenty of times and never had a problem. Today I was put on hold for over 20 minutes ignored and my order was missing items after I\\'ve paid for it. And When I called to complain I think someone took the phone off the hook so I kept calling until I was put on hold again for another 20 minutes. Probably won\\'t be back. The next time I think it\\'ll be fun to watch a scary movie, I\\'ll think back to last night when I stayed awake until 5am, anxiously waiting to either be dragged out of my bed by evil paranormal forces, or fall into a possessed state and kill my dog, my neighbors, and ultimately myself. Finally, when fatigue overwhelmed fear, I slept, but woke up only an hour later to the sound of my dog\\'s muffled dream-barks. \\n\\nThankfully, I knew holy humans with warm, reviving beverages were a mere 2 blocks away. I ventured out into the crisp morning air and despite the darkness at dawn, I thought it better to be mugged than remain captive to my racing imagination. \\n\\nOne cup of coffee later, I returned to my doomsday domicile, curled up on the couch and thumbed through my roommate\\'s coffee table literature: a photography book aptly titled, \"Women Before 10am.\" Better dreams next time. Avoid \"Paranormal Activity;\" it will haunt you! 6/2/2017\\nWe yelped this place, in search of a real Philly cheese steak experience. We ordered two cheese steaks with american cheese and onions. The sandwiches are over priced ($9.25) and the steak was not high quality. The staff was not friendly, and the person who took my order looked at me like I was from Mars. I won\\'t be back in this lifetime. Not really a big deal. This truck has recently been taken over by a new operator. That means... not the same cheery, wonderful staff and most likely not the same delicious food you all are used to.\\n\\nI will sincerely miss the original crew. The truck won\\'t be the same without them. Food cold. Service horrible. They have you put the tip on prior to getting the service and now I know why. Pathetic in every way. Servers uninterested in doing a good job. The place was a pigsty. Get your act together Simply put, it was extremely over priced, the food was terrible, and the wait staff was painfully inept. \\nNormally, my boyfriend and I like to hit El Camino Real, but wanted to mix it up and try this place out. I found the lighting to be way too dark and they sat us right near the door at this table the size of a postage stamp. The freezing temperatures rivaled the icy greeting we got from the wait staff. They were a bunch of very pretentious hip kids who told us nothing more then, \" Hey, check the board and tell us what you want.\" \\nOur waiter forgot my drink and the food, check, and refills took upwards of fifteen minutes each to get to us. We were moments from walking out because our waiter was more interested in fixing his hair and talking to his friends at the bar than in bringing our check.\\n\\nThe food, especially the salsa they give you with the chips was incredibly salty. I got a pork dish which tasted like sausage for some reason and some very undercooked vegetables (price for this awesomness - $20). My boyfriend got a $9 bean burrito without rice. When it showed up, it had rice on it and they couldn\\'t even bother to wash the salty liquid off of the beans when it comes from the can. Also, since the wait staff was so oblivious to us, they couldn\\'t manage to bus our table either so all of our drinks and plates were piled on top of each other, and we had to tippy toe around the table just so we didn\\'t knock anything over. \\n\\nThe only saving grace of our meal was my bloody orange mojito, which was strong and tasty. \\n\\nNever, never again..... Order the wings and the burgers and beer, but don\\'t go here if you are in the mood for something lighter like salad. They don\\'t make good salad. And the toffee pudding was dry and not very interesting.  Waitress was cool! So very bad!!! One customer as I arrived was leave because he had waited 15 minutes and had not had his order taken or even spoke to after being seated. We also waited around ten mins before our drink order was taken and another ten or so for our food order to be taken even though we said we are ready as our drink order was taken. The food was okay at best for taste but missing items like mushrooms and sauce. Ate there tonight. Not impressed at all. Had not been there for quite a few years. The New England clam chowder was way too thick. Ordered the seafood combo. Used to come with Chilean Sea bass. Now they cheat the customer and put a $4 piece of salmon on it instead. The Yukon whipped potatoes, the risotto and the asparagus were really good. The grilled shrimp was overcooked and the crab cake tasted very fishy. They used to have great mussels in a special red sauce,  but now they give you the basic white wine sauce. Things have really changed and the quality of the food was not worth the price we paid. Went to the cigar lounge next door Holts, awesome place. However, Ashton\\'s the cigar bar next door, not awesome. $10 cover and a club atmosphere. If you\\'re looking for a cigar bar, and like your stogie along with a relaxing atmosphere this is not the place. HORRIBLE service.  We were there for two hours on a Saturday night from 10:30p-12:30a.  It took us 55 minutes to receive the first (and only) round of drinks.  Ten minutes later we were seated.  Shortly thereafter, another waitress came over to take our order.  However she had far too much to drink and was too hammered to get our order.  She took our order verbally.   Thirty minutes later, and no drinks, we left.  I told the hostess on the way out that we had been there for almost two hours and only had one drink.  She really didn\\'t care.  We will never go back.   It has become too popular for them to care about their customers.  Two bad waitresses, a $10 cover charge, and mediocre cigars.   No thanks. Friendly but the wait was way to long for a food order to go. I got the backed mac and cheese. So overrated. I feel like I was taken advantage of by paying $14 for less than a cup of mac and cheese. Literally waited 23 mins, the blueberry corn bread was good but again, won\\'t be coming back and I would never suggest this as a place to come eat. It\\'s a pretty cool dive bar but that\\'s it. This place is expensive and has soggy food. The crab and shrimp were sour and hibachi was tasteless. It seems that the owner doesn\\'t care about freshness of the food or about this restaurant. The over serving going on in this place makes me sick. You can do shots all night and never get flagged. I have no idea how someone hasn\\'t left this place and killed someone. My good friend was hit on his motorcycle buy a  young women drunk out of her mind. She told him she had been drinking alone at the Black Horse all day. Thank god he is ok. I find it shocking that there are cameras everywhere inside and the over serving is allowed to go on. Hear me out on this rating. I go out to eat pretty often in the city, I just recently moved to Fishtown so I thought I\\'d check this place out. Honestly I was pretty bummed when I left. I went with my significant other, we started with the fried chicken and brussel sprouts. The chicken was eh at best, I\\'ve had better chicken and at half the price at Wishbone on 13th and Locust, and Andy\\'s in fishtown. Honestly I feel like even Popeye has better fried chicken. The brussel sprouts were $12 and we literally got three brussel sprouts cut in half. $12 for 3 brussel sprouts that were mediocre at best. For entrees I got the burger and my partner got the spicy beef. My burger was absolutely delicious and cooked exactly the way I wanted, but it was $20. Listen I\\'m all for a bomb burger, one that leaves you feeling super satisfied, but $20 for a regular burger with nothing special added to it? Just wayyy over priced. The spicy beef could not even be considered an entree, it was super tiny, an appetizer at best. Listen if you\\'re thinking of trying this place I\\'d seriously tell you to consider suraya, which is similar in pricing but absolutely delicious, or go to cheu or nunu which is a couple doors down. Seriously go anywhere but this place. Also, lastly, the service was extremely poor. It was very slow when it wasn\\'t even too busy. Just honestly save yourself the expensiveness of this place and go to the several other amazing places in fishtown. You\\'re welcome. Just really not good. It\\'s a nice looking place but that definitely doesn\\'t make up for overpriced, bland food. I\\'ve given them a couple of chances and come up disappointed every time. I was there a couple months ago just for drinks and I can\\'t even say good things about that. The bartender wasn\\'t attentive and when she finally did get to me, she didn\\'t know how much their drinks cost. I ordered a tequila sunrise for me and my girlfriend, and the way she made them, they came out dark red and disgusting with wayyy too much grenadine. Solaris isn\\'t worth the money. Love this place don\\'t love they messed up my order, left out some toppings, not enough sauce, didn\\'t cut the sandwich and had the nerve to leave it open ALL exposed for other folk to breathe on, reach over you get the point. How about keep the container closed until the person whose order it is is called. Or better still leave it closed and let me open it! Bad hygiene...  I know not enough sauce or cheese because I saw other people\\'s po boy sandwiches. Sooo what\\'s up with that? \\nFood is good and they are very nice and friendly they just need to be more mindful of consistency and changing that open container  rule. I started to say something but why you never complain or ask for another order hurts people\\'s feelings. Don\\'t come at 4 pm.   There was no help to meet us at the check in counter. We are still waiting for our our order after 15 minutes.   Oh the order didn\\'t go through.   Still waiting.  What a skit.   No use in coming in early to Red Robin \"Hi there! I\\'d like a soy smoothie please.\"\\n\"Sure, what size?\"\\n\"What are the sizes?\"\\nA decent pause. \\n\"Oh, we\\'re not making smoothies right now because we are too busy.\"\\n\"Oh, okay...thanks, bye.\"\\n\\nThis review is mainly for the cashier with the purple headscarf. Could you have not started with your last statement? The line wasn\\'t even long when I ordered. She clearly knew what I wanted and just didn\\'t want to make it. This place has such potential. The reason it doesn\\'t only get one star is purely for the atmosphere and cleanliness of the restaurant because that\\'s the only thing halfway decent about it. We came for lunch on a weekday and it was pretty much empty. The waitress did not want to be there and could barely crack a smile. For an app we ordered the fried pickles which were extremely salty and for me, inedible. For my main dish I ordered the spinach and steak salad which looked NOTHING like the picture. I got my steak medium rare and it came out raw and freezing cold. My boyfriend ordered the smokestack burger which came out fine. The waitress apologized multiple times for the salad and offered another dish, but I lost my appetite. The manager did come for a split second then disappeared. I would recommend sticking with the basics here. First, I\\'ll say that we all enjoyed the ceviches and the yucca buns at the start of the meal.  And the service was friendly, informed and attentive.\\n\\nI ordered the most basic, classic chifa dish: lomo saltado.  This dish (and some others we ordered) all suffered from excessive use of soy sauce and hoisin sauce, and some used hoisin sauce in ways never used in chifa dishes, resulting in gloppy, sweet sauces in dishes that don\\'t call for gloppy, sweet sauces.  \\n\\nIn the lomo saltado, the rice was placed at the bottom of the bowl underneath the meat, resulting in saturated, salty rice.  In the  thousand times I\\'ve eaten lomo saltado, I have never seen the rice served this way.  It is always served plain on the side to balance the saltiness of the meat.  Chifa\\'s version was difficult to eat because I had no way to cleanse my palate.  It was salty meat, with salty potato, with salty rice. The sauce also had a sweetness to it, which is not typical of that dish. \\n\\nAlso worth noting is that another person at our table had a steak with some type of coffee rub on it.  She said it was like eating coarse coffee grinds, and was working to srape it all off.\\n\\nI left Chifa a bit perplexed.  Have all the cooks there experienced real chifa dishes? Were they trying (but missing the mark) on re-creating the authentic dishes and didn\\'t realize it?  Or were they willfully trying to make them more interesting by adding unnecessary ingredients?\\n\\nI sensed that they were taking chifa dishes and pushing Asian fusion on them with hoisin and chiles. The introduction of those ingredients is an unnecessary intrusion.  Chifa and most Peruvian food is, by it\\'s very nature, a fusion of Latin and Asian flavors and cooking techniques.  They don\\'t need to add more Asian ingredients to somehow remind people of it.  \\n\\nIn the end, I\\'m not sure I\\'ll be back, especially when I have so many alternatives.  But I left wishing that I could take the staff on a field trip to a real chifa restaurant so they could see what they\\'re missing. first of all let me say im very mad about my delivery tonight i ordered food and took and hour and a half to come only ordered one sandwich pathetic and i only live local Mediocre food that is more expensive than it should be. With so many options in Conshy I\\'d be surprised if I returned.\\n\\nOur server was the best part of the experience, very friendly. Went for lunch...blacked out off mad elf....literally blacked out.\\n\\n\\ngreat cheese plate and short ribs over mac and cheese...i was told Very unhappy with the \"non\" service by the counter person working Thursday 3/3/16.  My foreman went into shop first and not only was he not greeted he was absolutely ignored.  My foreman is African American and I would hope the counter person was just rude and not prejudiced.  But when the owner of my construction company went in he was treated the same poor way so guessing this place has poor customer service.   It is a shame since there were no customers in the store and maybe that\\'s why.  Wont go back there! Service was good but the food sucks.  Pizza was bland, side salads consisting of iceberg lettuce and 1 grape tomato.  Linguine with white clam sauce was way too salty and skimpy on the clams.  Chicken parm also had no taste...there are so many excellent Italian restaurants in the area that this place should be avoided at all costs.  I\\'m Italian and this place is an embarrassment. No thank you.  The portions are small and I found the food to be more commercial than authentic, perhaps mellowed for American tastes?  However, this American girl likes traditional vietnamese fare & I recommend that you Yelp \"Little Saigon\" in Upper Darby 19082, or \"Cafe Anh Hong\", also in Upper Darby. I\\'ve been a few times for brunch. On one particularly nice day we were unable to get a seat outside, so that was disappointing but such is life. Our first brunch we had an awful waitress who probably could have sold an additional $75-100 worth of drinks if she had been more attentive. She had an attitude, talked us out of ordering certain things, forgot items 5x over..it was a mess. Subsequent visits have been better with better waitstaff overall. Terrible service. Will not go back here. The sign said they were open till 11, we went in to eat at 9:55 the hostess rolled her eyes and was super annoyed to seat is didn\\'t say anything just slammed our menus on the table and left. All of the servers were cleaning and didn\\'t even look at us we waited for 10 minutes and no one even spoke to us or came to get our order. We left and no one said anything. It\\'s like they ignored us so we would leave and they didn\\'t want to serve us. I know we came a little late but please customer service is always a good thing. And no one in that restaurant has any idea of what customer service is. I hope they didn\\'t have a night manager it didn\\'t look like they did. Being a manger I would never let anyone treat customers like that. You help till the end even 5 min before closing. Everyone counts. sick!!! stay away!! slow and nasty!!!!! I had written a lengthy review about this place and how you shouldn\\'t order from it. The owner has messaged me and told me he wants to make it right. \\n\\nThe problems were\\n\\n1. The deliverer had no change in her\\n2. Took an hour to get it\\n3. The bagels were wrong\\n4. We called and tried to explain to the workers what happened and they sasses us.\\n\\nI appreciate the message from the owner, they are clearly running a business and no one wants a bad review. I will take you up on your offer in the future. \\n\\nPeople - please make sure you have small bills and won\\'t have trouble if there is no change and also make sure you\\'re 100 specific with what you order and tell them\\nTo call if they can\\'t do what you want. I have to agree with a fellow Minado Reviewer that this place wasn\\'t worth the money, and I\\'d rather spend a bit more for better sushi. Most of the selections were fried, and none of the rolls looked appealing or fresh. \\n\\nI will say that the udon was good and so was the green tea soft serve. Though I will never come back here. The service used to be fine but over the past couple of months it has become abysmal.  They need a hostess, a person answering the phone for take-out and an extra server or two.  And hire people who can multi-task.  Our last time there it became a game to guess what the single hostess/waitress/receptionist was going to do.  \"Is she going to grab the wine bottles off their table right next to us and go and open those then come back and pour their wine, even though we are at the table right next to them and have been waiting for 30 minutes to place our order and she could take care of us on the way back to open the wine at which time she would also be right by the computer and could put our order in? Or will she make us wait another ten minutes while she does all of this? She went with B at which point she also took a couple phone orders while opening the wine and we continued to wait.   \\n\\nThe time before this, this same waitress/hostess/receptionist totally forgot to put our order in.  After 30 minutes we asked where our apps were and there was an \"oh no! it was never put in\" moment, after which they took care of us.  So this is twice with horrible service and it is really wearing thin.  Waiters get paid $3 an hour so why in the world would you not hire a couple????? I\\'m giving them one more chance and I made such a stink the last time there (in an honest and calm way) they will likely remember me and hopefully do better.\\n\\nI love the food with the exception that  like most Chinese food, sometimes it is way too salty. It isn\\'t a dish by dish issue but just a who happens to be cooking that day and what are they doing with the dish issue. I have been here ten times and this has been an issue twice. The food is too oily and leaves me with an upset stomach for about 24 hours after I eat it. The lassi\\'s are too watery. It\\'s a little overpriced too.\\n\\nCheck out either Ekta or Tiffin before this place. Beautiful inside and totally empty. She almost questioned why we didn\\'t have a reservation... serious?  Menu small with interactive choices. Prices low but understand when I got my food.  Let\\'s just say it looked like hh appetizers. Had to order a second meal. Yes it was a meal.  My friends steak was cold.  I got my 2 meals before her one came.  Complained and didn\\'t matter he just poured my wine a little la get which was still pathetic.\\n\\nWill not go back nor recommend it to anyone.  Food ok but tiny and overpriced and service was arrogant. this place is known for prime rib. the ppl in my group who ordered that were extremely pleased. the waiteress was very attentive. that being said, the other food is pretty bad. the lettuce on the side of my quesadilla was browning. and the sour cream on the side came in a little container. the presentation was just cheap. some ppl dont mind that. and it works for some restaurants...but here the whole feel is just uncomfortably cheap. Me and my friends r here right now. I ordered a Sea Urchin, but it was not fresh at all! Also, I ordered tuna, salmon and other sashimi. Fish r just fine. But the sea urchin tasted awful and smelled bad!! Moreover, I told them the sea urchin was not fresh but they insisted that their food is fresh. However, one of the waiter said the sea urchin that they provide(somewhere in California) just different from my country but doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not fresh. Oh! I\\'m sorry! I have been to California b4 and I did try Sea Urchin there. So r u saying that the only sushi bar that I have been is ur one? And the only California Sea urchin that i have tired is in ur bar??!!! I asked u nicely but u just gave me attitude! If u could simply change it or swatch other things, it would be good. But don\\'t show ur attitude to ur clients! I strongly do not recommended this sushi bar coming here! She(yes, the one) ruined my weekend! Disappointment. Skip this place and walk 10 minutes down to Aki or Raw. Same price, way better quality and won\\'t leave you feeling so frustrated. \\n\\nA few of us were at the convention center for the week, and decided to reward ourselves to sushi meal(s). \\n\\nWe came here at 8PM tonight, and was greeted by a very confused server (guy with glasses). And I mean, very confused and not tentative. We had 5 people, and he managed to screw up 5 orders.\\n\\n1) ordered a honey green tea with aloe. The drink did not come with aloe. When I informed the waiter, he went to the back and added jelly. I informed him that I requested for aloe, not jelly (!!!) and finally he told me they did not have aloe. I tired not to make a big deal, but IF YOU DONT HAVE IT, TELL ME?! Don\\'t just add something else and force me to take it..gosh\\n2)ordered a HOT chocolate boba, came as iced..(is it that hard?!)\\n3)one of us ordered a eel hand roll, and was offered the eel rice plate....ended up canceling that order \\n4)another one of us ordered a tempura combo (with rice, salad and miso) and was given the appetizer...............\\n5) ordered the soup shrimp udon, and was given the sautéed (dry) udon  \\n\\nNothing really good to say about this place, now about everything else..\\n-my udon soup was really weak. The shrimp were soggy and small..looks like it was just our average frozen shrimp (picture). Fortunately, I can make better instant udon purchased at Asian markets.\\n- notice, no credit card charges under 10$\\n-gratuity was included our bill (of 5 people) and there was an additional line on our check for more tip. NOPE. I\\'m always giving this place a \"second\" chance but it never gets any better. Overly priced for what you get.  They are trying to be fancy but it\\'s not working. Manayunk is at a loss for good brunch spots anymore. You\\'d think places with small menus would be better since they don\\'t have a lot to work with....the breakfast potatoes always taste like they are old and just reheated in the fryer. Coffee is mediocre and usually luke warm. Pancakes are probably the best thing on the menu! Also being known for bread, their bread baskets come out cold and slightly stale. I want to like it but.... The food is not very good at all and the staff is not accommodating\\u200b.  They seem to think their food is much better than it is. I do like that they offer outdoor seating. We went in with our son sleeping in his stroller. The hostess stopped us to say we can take the stroller into the restaurant as we would block all fire exits. We disputed that and she argued against us, with her fellow hostesses joining in. We told them we\\'d have to leave if we couldn\\'t take him to the table with us and they simple said ok. Didn\\'t offer to find a solution, though the restaurant was half empty. They simply could care less. I would not recommend going if you gave a child. They will not be helpful whatsoever! Worst customer service I\\'ve experienced in a while! I would give this 1.5 stars if able but the only saving grace is that the front end manager was very attentive. Kooma was once the best sushi in West Chester but seems to have let the quality of its employees and food deteriorate. I sadly picked this place for my 30th birthday lunch with my mom and we both had a bento box and since it was a special occasion I got two pieces of uni. The server asked me if I wanted it sushi or sashimi so this was obviously a bad sign of things to come. \\n\\nIt took over forty minutes just to get a bento box out. By the time it had been delivered to me, the fried rice and shumai were both cold. I thought maybe the uni would be the saving grace however it tasted like ammonia. If I end up getting sick because of it this review will go down even further. I am not sure if it is worth giving this place a second chance now that there are other sushi options in West Chester. Sad to see this place go so far down hill. This place is awful. Waited 25 minutes for food and the order wasn\\'t even correct. Meanwhile 5 employees were standing around doing nothing. I\\'m sure I didn\\'t order rubber. In fact, I\\'m pretty positive I didn\\'t. \\n\\nHowever, sure enough, four slices of plain pizza between me and my friend proved to be slathered with just that - cheese that cools down into tasteless rubber. The cashier lady was extremely nice, though, so the service was great. \\n\\nSad to say, I will not be returning for anymore stale, flavorless pizza. I mean, good pizza SHOULD be able to maintain its integrity after being out of the oven for more than two minutes. Overpriced, slow, unorganized, and got order wrong. Save your time and money and don\\'t even bother. So my wife is a Foody out of DC and she seen this place on one of her food networks. Says she wants to try the Roast Pork. Now I\\'m from Philly \"Go Eagles\" and I\\'m familiar with most steak places. We live near Harrisburg so the drive wasn\\'t nothing. We make the trip and go in today 08/30/18 around lunchtime. Place was not as crowded as I thought it would be so that was a plus for no waiting time. TV makes small places look bigger than it is so it\\'s true that the camera adds ten pounds. Don\\'t mind my humor. I already know what I want so I ordered the chicken spinach provolone I believe it was. She changed her mind on the pork roast and just wanted fries. I\\'m baffled because I thought that\\'s why we\\'re here. Then I see why she changed her mind, together from the grill, asked customer for any condiments, wrapped it up with NO GLOVES! So my sandwich is already ordered and now I\\'m worried because I really want to try my sandwich and I already paid. My name is called and lucky the girl at the counter is wearing a glove to wrap up my meal. It was still handled by the cook but maybe he seen the look in my eyes and changed it up some. It was wrapped up so quick so maybe I didn\\'t need any condiments nor was I asked.  Long story short. Took it home any ready to dig into which was two hours later. Open it up to add my own condiments and was like plenty of chicken and cheese but where is the SPINACH? So disappointed and understand why the wife was. Won\\'t be coming back but I\\'ll stick to what I know. Gooey Looies is my spot. A TV spot didn\\'t make there heads big or forgo sanitation. I say take a chance if you don\\'t mind the extra sweat it takes to make it. Enjoy! I\\'ve dined at several restaurants in the city and have been wanting to check out Devon Seafood. My family was visiting from out of town and we decided to give it a shot. From the minute we walked in the door, we unfortunately weren\\'t very impressed. The hostess was kind of rude and unapproachable, and upon being seated the light above our table kept turning on and off to the point of it being really annoying. The manager did offer for us to move to another table, which was nice, but being halfway through our meal when she finally approached us, it wasn\\'t worth it. \\n\\nOn to the food: the calamari was delicious! Light and battered perfectly. Definitely a must-try. As for my entree, I ordered the swordfish and it was totally under seasoned. We had to ask the server for salt and pepper to add a little oomph to it. My mom had the ahi tuna which she enjoyed, but noted it lacked seasoning as well. My dad ordered the mahi mahi which came out totally raw. My dad has been in the restaurant business for 35 years, and hardly ever sends food back. The server who we were finally able to flag down was incredibly dismissive, grabbing my dad\\'s plate and not acknowledging the issue at all. Totally not the way to handle a $35-$40 piece of fish when we were incredibly polite about the situation. \\n\\nOverall the food wasn\\'t bad but,for the price, the selections as well as the customer service could have used a bit of seasoning. Part of an enjoyable meal is the staff who cares about its execution and the overall environment of the restaurant. The staff at Devon weren\\'t exactly the most enthusiastic, which for me, unfortunately really soured our experience. We won\\'t be returning. Well i went to this location because i didn\\'t fell like driving to the one on front and chestnut and what a mistake.First of all i sat outside and little did i know it was feeding time for the homeless across the street in the park so i had to watch that wile i ate ,dont get me wrong i dont have anything against homeless but when somebody is eating 20 ft away from me spitting up and slobering on themselves its disgusting .Oh did i mention the food absolutely sucks ....i was about to go across the street and get in line. I\\'m not a huge fan of Vietnamese food so my review will be skewed somewhat towards the negative (I\\'ve had amazing Vietnamese food, but none so far in the Philly area).\\n\\nThe service was nonexistent and the food came out way too salty and greasy.\\n\\nUnless you like diarrhea (and I have a few friends who actually do), you should probably check out another restaurant though in this plaza area really lacks anything good.\\n\\nParking: Large shared lot\\nPrice: $7+ per person\\nWait: Little to none The only positive thing about Palermo\\'s is the pizza.  It\\'s awesome.  On the other hand, I have a lot to say about the pricing.  $18 for a large plain pizza is absolutely ridiculous.  Palermo\\'s used to be a family favorite when it was reasonably priced at its old location.  However, since moving to its newly-built facility, the prices have skyrocketed.  It seems like they are trying to make up the costs of the move and the new building by jacking up the price of the pizza.  We don\\'t go to Palermo\\'s as much anymore. Mediocre food with horrible service.  Frozen salmon served raw.  No apologies made for bad meal.   During lunch service, with only 3 tables full, music was playing so loud it was difficult to hear the person across the table. After a long wait, have to say wasn\\'t worth it. Don\\'t like the fact that after the girls handle your ice cream they then handle the money! Yuk!! Poor service during bruch/lunch. Just one person serving 15 - 20 people. Food quality was good. Keep having a problem w the same employee. S/he is very very sarcastic and rude and is in an extreme hurry to get you out of there as fast as possible. Interrupts you mid sentence saying \"Yup!!!\" And repeats the order back to you as if you are stupid. Will stop coming if this employee keeps treating me like a child...\\n\\nOld review: the girl with the glasses has a very sarcastic attitude. Can never tell if she\\'s being rude or over polite. To the management please give your employees ethics lessons!! No way to treat customers. There is such a thing as too polite. Still charging extra for cheese sauce secretly... they will not tell you... just a it on at checkout and have you wondering why it\\'s so expensive!! Buyer beware!!!! Be more upfront about your policies!!! Was very underwhelmed by portions, quality of food, and managerial response to our issues. We came on Xmas Eve and the food was subpar at best. Service was wonderful, and I appreciated how attentive our waiter, Nate was. However, the food itself was pitiful in quantity and quality. Upon complaining that our Corvina tastes fishy, we were told by the hostess the chef denied our claims and offered no apology. Disappointing. Save your money and go elsewhere. Sad, because I used Yelp and the positive reviews to bring my family here. \"UNACCEPTABLE SERVICE!!!\" \\nVery upset and will not be returning\\nPlaced order leaving center city.  Arrived, paid for order and then told cook was not in. \\nNo problem I ran around the corner for a small item returned. Still no cook. \\nFine return my $7.45 and cancel the order. I gave him $.55 back to round off to eight but I guess he was unable to do the math and figure out I should have received $8.00 back\\nOh, he wanted me to round it off to the $20.00 I initially gave him. \\nPoor kid. If he is unable to do the math, he should return to school \\nOh, and finally they had to also go back and review the camera as if I was robbing them or did not pay for my purchase.\\nI was picking up for someone else but I will never purchase from them ever. \\nSo be mindful. ASK if the cook is in and if they have someone that can count and make changer accurately in the event of a refund or error\\nAlso be mindful. When They were trying to figure out my refund. I asked them to speak English and they continued in their native tongue Don\\'t go here for the food. Don\\'t go here for the beer. Don\\'t go here for the ambiance.  The only positive was that our server was prompt and pleasant.  \\n\\nThe Chicken Nachos were microwaved and barely had any chicken on them.\\n\\nI ordered the chipotle chicken sandwich. It was so drowned in cheese that I couldn\\'t taste anything else.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the Reuben sandwich, also smothered in cheese with hardly any sauerkraut.\\n\\nThere were only 4 beers on tap. \\n\\nWe were seated upstairs where it was about 85 degrees and they had the fireplace going. If you make a reservation and arrive early to be told we\\'ve over booked it just becomes a matter of time before it gets you negative reviews \\nSnotty management doesn\\'t help as well \\nto insure repeat visits \\nVery annoying \\nRick\\nAdd side note for hamburger lovers \\nSomethings different here/plain no excitement ( use to be the best)\\nJust one more comment, I had received a gift card from WD and presented it when bill came to be told it did not apply\\nWILL NEVER RETURN \\nWILL SHARE With OTHERS\\nToo many other choices Ate here for Saturday morning breakfast. Cute little place...very little. Fortunately we were lucky to be seated immediately. Menu selection was okay....variety of items but not much of a variety of each item. Staff was very nice (my reason for more than 1 star), but service was extremely slow. They seem to do a lot of takeout, so that must eat up a lot of kitchen time. So if u want a quick meal (not fast food, but a quick diner experience), this is not the place. If u have plenty of time to sit and wait, then the food will be worth it. Since this store opened things have gone downhill. Not only is the parking lot a DISASTER every single morning, but I just found out, after waiting in line for so long, that they don\\'t carry BISCUITS anymore. Biscuits! I mean, that\\'s a very basic breakfast staple that Dunkin has carried since basically the beginning of time.\\n\\nBring back the biscuits and I might tolerate the clusterfuck of a parking lot to spend my money with you again.\\n\\nOh, and they stopped carrying onion bagels. WTF?!?!?! WORST ASIAN FOOD EVER. When the food arrived, you thought, wow, big portions. But, that just meant bigger portions of horrible food.  The Yakisoba, NO TASTE, NONE and the chicken was just as bland.  The Teriyaki, didn\\'t taste like teriyaki, but more like barbeque that had been left out for a couple days.  The meat was tough and fatty and it tasted horrible.  The SUSHI, the Boston Roll was NASTY. I am used to salmon that isn\\'t firm, but it isn\\'t supposed to be so squishy you can\\'t tell it is salmon. It was almost like a paste. To top it all off...25 minutes later, my wife vomited up her meal.  AVOID!!! Where do I begin? My ice tea was slimy(Probably sipped) and not what I ordered, the pizza roll was nearly cold, the sauce was cold, and delivery took over an hour. They\\'re 5 mins from me! They are taking people\\'s money now and not returning calls! The business is for sale as well per this new story. Don\\'t give those folks your hard earned money!\\n\\nhttp://www.fox29.com/news/woman-says-local-banquet-hall-closed-after-she-paid-for-baby-shower It\\'s just a chain restaurant. It is not spectacular food or service. The waiters and waitresses were all right, no one was rude at least. \\n\\nBut the seafood here was completely disappointing. I ordered some kind of shrimp as an appetizer and it was way too spicy and not good. I got scallops as a main dish, and they were rubbery and tough in the center - obviously improperly cooked, as I make my own scallops better than this. They were not the best scallops I\\'d ever eaten. It\\'s too expensive for the quality. \\n\\nIf you want really excellent seafood don\\'t go here. Like I said: it\\'s just a big chain establishment that has mediocre food. Also, the Exton place is VERY crowded now, and almost claustrophobic, and the noise level can get loud. Not good for kids either. Worst service. I ordered the pizza for delivery and it\\'s already 120 mins and I haven\\'t received my delivery yet. Called manager to know the status of the delivery, even he didn\\'t gave the proper response. Overpriced... but, hey, it\\'s close to home.  If you have time, go downtown to the Reading Terminal Market.  (And remember to get your parking validating by EACH vendor so pay next to nothing to park.)  The Ardmore Market preys off the Main Line crowd who don\\'t care how much it costs.  If you know of a more local market with good product and price, let me know.\\n\\nThe seafood joint here sold us some bad frozen seafood broth and ruined the lobster bisque we made for New Year\\'s Eve dinner.  We gave it another chance recently but the scallops released a lot of water when we sauteed them.\\n\\nThe cheese shop is the only place worth the price.  Very knowledgable staff. We were so excited to try this place we walked in and the place was literally empty! The hostess rudely asked if we had reservations (no) then asked if we were VIP (no) she then said ok 45 min wait... What? There\\'s no one here. We asked if we could sit at the bar she said if you can find a seat... We found 10 seats. Now for the food.. We ordered the Mac attack burger and trash can nachos both were really good but I just can\\'t get the bad taste out of my mouth the way we were treated. The drinks were also good... Sweet tea hard and Stacy\\'s mom IPA. They never did call our name so we ate at the bar while the tables remained empty. Never going back This is my first time at a karaoke bar. Since it was my brother\\'s selection to celebrate his birthday, I showed up. Place is very nice it has 2 floors. We did a VIP section so we just don\\'t be standing around. One the prices are way to high for a bottle and you sit at this little square seats. The bar is long but tight! The volume of the karaoke made both my ears ring. The bathroom sink didn\\'t even work. I had to use this tiny sink that was outside the hall. Me and my sister decided to sign in to sing to make the best of it. After we sung our selected song the short man that worked behind the bar came around and snatched the mic. We was going to hand it back to the bar, rude. Never returning. If I could give them a zero I would! We ordered through uber eats and half the order was wrong!! We called the restaurant and he was very dismissive and had excuses for giving us the wrong drink and soup (they didn\\'t have what we wanted and no way to contact us to see if we wanted something different)-- which I can take that and be fine with it but then argued that he made us the right salad even though I am looking right at it and it is CLEARLY not the right one!! The sad part is I eat at perkins (not this location) a lot and I know what I ordered and how it should look and I know exactly what you sent me with out even looking at the menu!!! Lastly the \"dressing\" was actually just honey mustard sauce and it was out dated by almost 5 months. I\\'m not a terribly picky person but like I said the dude was very dismissive and just told me to call uber eats and they would handle it. Seriously this is YOUR food and it was wrong that\\'s not Uber\\'s problem that is your chefs problem and him not knowing the menu! If you would have been nice I would have shrugged it off as an accident and moved on with my life!! Not good. At first yes, but, they use a lot of canola oil, even tried to tell me it was olive oil for my salad, uh, no, it wasn\\'t. I am allergic to it and it simply is bad for you. \\nReally has gone down hill. That\\'s a shame. When you use cheap ingredients, it shows...and tastes bad, got sick several times after eating there. Two words: Cheap Ingredients. I don\\'t buy cheap ingredients when I cook at home, should I go out and eat cheap ingredients that they charge quadruple for? You can answer that one. My first and last visit. After being seated, it took 15 minutes to be acknowleged that we were there. They were trying to figure out who our server was. Another 15 minutes was added to our wait, for burgers and fries. Mind you, there were 10+ empty tables. Maybe it was a shift change, I don\\'t know. The one saving grace was our server, Brii. She was polite and attentive. She is to be commended. We were a party of 9 adults for my mothers birthday dinner. The service was beyond horrible from the moment we sat down and as the dinner went on it got progressively worse. We had asked to speak to a manager hoping things would change and they didnt. Here are a few things that occurred, waited 45 mins for appetizers, and then another hr after that for dinner only to be served cold and undercooked food.  Would not recommend this restaurant nor will not be returning. First let me say we really wanted to like this place. Before we stopped in I read some reviews. I should have listened to the other elites. Upon entering the place was dead! At noon on a Thursday, that was strange. The floors were also very sticky, first thing I noticed walking in. The guy taking orders was very nice. He went through the menu and ordering process because it was our first time there. \\n\\nNow for the food. We started with the chips and queso with a side of salsa. The chips were stale and in pieces, we\\'ve had better out of a bag. The salsa was ok but was not fresh as stated, it was from a jar. The queso was the worst and tasted like it came from a can. My wife ordered a fajita salad with chicken. The salad was bare bones and lame. The fajita vegetables were raw, who does that? Raw onions and green peppers. They only offer 2 types of salad dressing. The chicken was seasoned well but there wasn\\'t much of it. I went with the 2 tacos and added and extra. All 3 were steak with everything. The shells I swear we\\'re out of a box. The steak was seasoned well but again there wasn\\'t much meat and it was extremely thin. The tacos were edible but not great. I could have made better at home. Paid $3.00 for guacamole and never received. They also make you pay for water. They do have fountain machines, they usually have a water feature. We were told only bottles were available. As a previous person said, there aren\\'t any trashcans in the joint....\\n\\nI would not go back at all. The food was mediocre at best and it\\'s very expensive. $33.00 for a bad lunch, we could have went to Chipotle for a much better lunch. 1 star for customer service. Very disappointing.  There was a sign outside the door that listed the specials for the day - none of which were actually available.  The girl who took my order sheepishly acknowledged that \"Yeah, we really need to take that sign down\".  I ended up getting the dolce de leche, which was basically flavorless, with a little bit of caramel buried at the bottom.\\n\\nWe took my mom there to introduce her to gelato, and it was not representative :-( Stale donuts.  Poorly made specialty drinks.  The place is called Dunkin Donuts and should have decent donuts all day, not excuses. My husband and I had dined here several times before and had oysters previously multiple times. We decided to go for the happy hour buck a shuck. We ordered 6 oysters, however, found the back of the shell with WORMS!!! (See pic.)\\n\\nWe were horrified and immediately asked to speak to the manager. Our plate was taken away promptly and we were told that we would be given more oysters in place of the worm-infested ones. So we frantically googled what was \"normal\" and were health hazards. Although these worms (if they are the mud worms that we have seen online) are supposedly not harmful to the body, the way the restaurant handled the situation was seriously unprofessional. AND don\\'t restaurants of this caliber have methods of cleaning the food before serving? (See links: http://www.gov.pe.ca/photos/original/FARD_ain03.2001.pdf and http://portal.ncdenr.org/web/mf/oyster-worms).\\n\\nIssues:\\n1) the manager NEVER came to speak to us\\n2) we were not at all assured by the dismissive nature of the staff\\n3) we were given new oysters rather than a choice to something else or just having it taken off the bill entirely or anything else to rectify the situation\\n4) Cleaning food before serving is an expectation that all customers deserve. Even IF the worms are a sign of how fresh the oysters are, I would still hope they would clean the oysters and hopefully spend some effort in educating their customers rather than leaving them horrified. We\\'ve had oysters all around the world, and in the city, this has never happened to us. I heard so many great things about Amada, so I was very disappointed when I actually got to experience their food. I\\'m not quite sure if it was because we went during Restaurant Week, but the food was just sub-par. \\n\\nThe Croquetas de Jamon (ham croquettes) were very boring and forgettable. Something about the texture wasn\\'t quite right. \\nThe Chorizo A La Plancha wasn\\'t very good either. I usually really like chorizo, so when I got these glorified hot dogs, it was pretty disappointing.\\nThe Calamari A La Plancha was too chewy and soggy.\\nThe Patatas Bravas (spicy potatoes) weren\\'t really spicy, but rather very salty. We took a few bites and ended up leaving the rest on the plate.\\n\\nThe only redeeming part of the meal was the Pastel de Chocolate (flourless chocolate cake, chocolate ice cream and chocolate-hazelnut cara). \\n\\nIn addition to the disappointing meal, we were further let down when the server erroneously charged us $20 extra. It was a good thing one of us was paying attention to the bill. On the surface this place seems to check the right boxes: aesthetic nice, good drink list, nice variety of meal options. But the execution for the price, which is high, doesn\\'t work. And the front of the house isn\\'t helping. Seems understaffed. Wait time to even order is way too long and it takes long to get the food. People next to us never had a server come, just left. Based on reviews that doesn\\'t seem uncommon. Owner has to step up and make some changes. Wow. Attitude from a rooftop club/lounge called \"stratus\" that is scraping the skies on the eleventh floor of a hotel. Already we have a problem. Add to that the fact that I\\'m staying at the hotel below and they won\\'t let you in unless you wait in line (actually a series of ropes that regulate the crowd of...zero). More bouncers and doormen than patrons. This went from infuriating to bemusing to total clown show. And the coup d\\'grace is the bouncer tells me he can\\'t let me in with my shoes.  Annoying in any event but laughable because they were really nice black leather Adidas originals--pretty cool if I do say so myself-- and at least cool enough for the lounges we went to in miami and ny.  Lounges with people in them. But I guess philly is the trendsetter now? Ok. Live and learn. Mind you, I was just in the club a couple hours ago while my wife was getting ready for a late dinner and it was nothing special--smallish bar, narrow deck with no view.  But when we got back I thought we\\'d have a nightcap because it is at least close, little did I know it was studio 54 all of a sudden. I think the lack of a line and the fact that the lobby restaurant had more people says it all. Bad business and an embarrassment to the otherwise effortlessly hip kimpton chain of hotels. I\\'ve been to Haru on Park Ave in NYC midtown many times and the happy hour specials are awesome.  I trekked out to Olde City to take advantage of the DailyCandy Tasting Menu for 2 and it was absolutely terrible.  Also, the scorpion punch is SO sweet.  The strawberry and jalepeno drink was not great either.  Our waitress was on her first day on the job and she seemed very out of place and confused most of the time.  The tacos were good but everything that came after, down to the sushi and dessert even was ALL FRIED.  If I want to eat unhealthy deep fried food, I\\'d go to an American restaurant, not a sushi joint.  Very disappointed and the food was really not great.  I recommend that those who are in the area and want sushi stick to the basics like the traditional sushi or sashimi combos.\\n\\nThe venue is interesting...I don\\'t like the downstairs area but the upstairs is gorgeous. Needed a quick coffee and snack before meetings. Ordered a Nitro coffee and was given what I believe is a nitro iced tea. If that truly is a Nitro coffee then it has to be the worst I have ever had. Usually you can see the layers after it is poured and it has a creamy finish. Also ordered a cinnamon roll muffin. It does not taste anything like a cinnamon roll and instead is overpowered with walnuts or pecans. I felt like I was in the lunchroom at Morgan Stanley. Loud, bad service, and too may dudes talking about money. While I like the food this place cannot read an order correctly. They messed up my order last week and then refused to redeliver the food. Luckily, I ordered online so the website took care of the issue and reimbursed me. Who doesn\\'t re-deliver? You gave me something I didn\\'t ask for and then won\\'t correct the mistake? How strange.\\n\\nOrdered again this week, different item, and same thing. I asked for no cheese and added garlic, I got no garlic and lots of cheese. So, needless to say, this place is out. Too much hassle for me. Ordering food is supposed to be easy. I met up with a new friend at Local 44 on a Sunday night.  That is when they were having a quiz night.  Quiz nights are a lot of fun if you\\'re participating, but if you\\'re trying to chat, not such a good place.  \\n\\nThe other thing was there was no A/C and the air was not circulating at all.  I left completely drenched in sweat just from sitting at the bar.\\n\\nThat said, the bartenders were friendly, the crowd was just my speed (mid to late \\'20s/early \\'30s, not preppy, not too hipstery, just right).  I would totally go back there when it wasn\\'t so hot. 7/10/12 - visited to calm down & have a good meal for once. \\n\\nWas going to order the Sanceere but at the last minute i changed my mind & asked Amanda, my server for a beer insjtead. She suggested the [dr:]Allagash seasonal Black IPA? - she wasnt certain & i was so i ordered itthought it was goingto be good & it.\\n\\n[to eat:] my normal Spinach Ravioli. This dish is always inconsistent. There hasnt been one time i revisited & the Ravioli was almost the same as before.  There\\'s either too much oil, too much butter, too little spinach/ricotta mixture with the ravioli, & the Rav looks as though it was shaped by the most inexperienced linecook i\\'ve ever experienced. They get a 5/10 just for that. \\n\\nAt this visit it was the massive amounts of oil drowning the ratouille - my favorite part. And what sucks is, is that i\\'ll order it agin because its near the park which i love & i enjoy the interior & atmosphere.\\nNext time i will \\nIn the of service my server, Amanda was very nice & gave some bery nice suggestions which i took on beer.  However, i could see that she was visibly irratated with the lack of upsell & my neurotic behavior.  GET over it i say, thats the name of the game, \"please the customer at all costs, & do it with a wink. & a smile.\"\\n\\nIt seems to me that Stephen Starr\\' flagship is becoming complacent & soon the entire city will know the place is no longer holding detail above all else. 0 stars if I could. It was my worst dinner experience out I\\'ve had in a year. And really disappointed to have spent $100 on food alone. \\nI returned 2 dishes. The melon soup which was super heavily salted. And the crab cake slider thing which had no taste or salt at all and a weird dish all together. \\nI saw the guys next to me complain about the literally one asparagus and one mushroom they got all cut up to look like more. I\\'m glad I witnessed and did not spend $10 on this. \\nI wish I could have returned more items but was too embarrassed at this point. \\nThe carrot dish which tasted of varietal baby food carrot Pürees. \\nThe forgettable \"spaghetti and meatball\" where was the taste in the sauce or the seasoning in he ball?\\nOr the star gnocchi dish which was ruined by being blackened and charred on one side. Later a familiar chef friend talked to this chef who admitted he remembered sending that dish out looking \"a little too rustic\". No!!! It was Burnt!!!! Always a hit or miss. Either it\\'s great service and food is perfect and timely, or it\\'s a train wreck of missing servers, missing food, or even worse, raw food. I\\'ve been here probably 6-7 times and half of them resulted with a raw steak, way over cooked steak, and uncooked chicken. Almost a strange coincidence. Each time I sent it back, it would be 15-20 minutes until I got new food. At least the manager would apologize. I was really disappointed with our takeout last night. The steamed vegetable dumplings were terrible. The sauce that came with them made them worse. It didn\\'t look like sauce that usually comes with dumplings. It was clear and had a strong vinegar taste.  Next up was the Dan Dan Noodles, which was plain pasta with just some minced pork on top. The dish was missing that chili oil sauce (not sure what it\\'s called). What we had was bland and disappointing.  The saving grace was the Mongolian beef, which was very good. The worst service ever.  We went there for dinner and after 50 minutes of waiting we left.  The waitress clearly forgot to put our order in and no one seemed to care. Don\\'t even bother with this place and a weekend night or any time they are clearly busy.. \\n\\nWe ordered a large pizza on a Friday night. The person I spoke with on the phone was clearly in a rush and I barely got a time estimate before they hung up. When I got there the parking lot was full, which that fact alone would have kept me from ever revisiting. To top it all off the pizza was probably the most sloppily made pizza I\\'ve ever seen. There seemed to only be cheese on about half of it, it was slightly burnt, and the toppings were just thrown on in large clumps rather than evenly spread. It was so awful we ended up throwing half of it away since nobody wanted to eat it.\\n\\nI\\'ve eaten good food from other Cocco\\'s locations so I know their quality can be better. I certainly don\\'t intend to waste my time at this location ever again. I\\'d travel farther to one I can trust. This has been a go to quick lunch or dinner spot for my boyfriend and I for almost a year. After dinner last night we both became nauseous and I was sick all night. Positive that I got food poisoning from our dinner. Will not be going back. I went for lunch today and was literally nauseated by the overwhelming stench of what I assume is the yeast used in the brewing process. It was horrible! I\\'ve been to a dozen breweries for food and have never experienced this. I had the brawler burger which was so greasy, the bun was sopping and disintegrating. The food here is great and service is with a smile. What\\'s not great is sitting at the booth along the back wall hearing all of the mice squeaking behind you that are inside the wall. Or looking down at the floor by the table beside you and actually SEEING a mouse. I\\'ll never go back. Please call an exterminator! It had been years since I was here, and I should have checked in on Yelp, but nostalgia called and I popped in for lunch. Wow what a sad, sad thing. As Brian P noted, this place used to be the goto deli for any special occasion (that required deli sandwiches). No more. The small, 3\\' deli counter held a bowl of potato salad, a bowl of macaroni salad, and three types of lunchmeat. There were perhaps a dozen rolls in a small bin off to the side of the lottery tickets, and five dingy, poorly illuminated booths. A dozen or more fridges of beer and miscellaneous booze lined the rest of the space, with one \\'aisle\\' of \\'groceries\\'. Yes, the potato and macaroni salad was Moe\\'s original recipe, (they must have sold it with the name), but I won\\'t be back again, so this will be a last yummy taste of a once grand dame. The service was okay but combined with the awful food makes this restaurant a place to miss!  There are too many other good restaurants in the area to even consider a second trip! I had heard a lot about this restaurant and was excited to get some drinks with some friends there.  I was dissapointed by the rude waiters and waitresses who seemed overwhelmed by our group of five...They didn\\'t want us to sit in the pathway (fire hazard) so we scooted back so that we would be out of the way.  When a table cleared that would put us completely out of the path, they made a stink and said the table had to be in an exact position so that it wouldn\\'t wobble.  It appeared that everything we did was a problem.  They were not friendly at all!!! When we ordered a cheese and meat and crackers appetizer it took about 45 minutes, which is ridiculous, considering nothing had to be cooked!  The drinks were about 10-12$ but it was as if us just ordering drinks was a problem and accounted for some of the rudeness...  I would go back for dinner but was told the only veggy option, the stuffed bell pepper, was dry and uncooked. Sorry to give a negative review this time. But we went for my brother\\'s birthday. He picked the place. It had been about 20 years and last time we went, we were kids last time and we got kicked out twenty years ago. He just wanted to know if our pictures were on the wall on not being invited again. \\n\\n\\n   Well back to the dinner. First off, our waiter was not really that nice, kind of ticked off. It seemed he had something else on h is mind. Our food took forever to get here and it was noting to be desired. It was just inedible. We had to wait over forty five minutes for our check but believe me we still had a good time, just a horrible meal. My brother did apologize over dozen of times. On the plus side, the appetizers and the rolls (although they gave us just one) were edible. We\\'re still not coming back. Not very happy. Went for a friends birthday dinner. The food was so-so. Not great, but certainly not bad. The service was good except for the fact the server upcharged the heck out of us without informing. Let me explain...Requested a pitcher of the basic margarita, the server quickly tried to upsell us and we declined. We clearly expressed that we just wanted the basic pitcher. Then he suggested another tequila. We looked for it on the list, could not find it, and he said it wasn\\'t there. We asked if it was comparable and he said yes. Next thing we know the bill comes and it was a $45 per pitcher compared to $27. You judge if that is comparable. We won\\'t be back. This place holds an awesome location in Chestnut Hill- that\\'s pretty much the only positive.  I came here to have lunch two weeks ago. The place was half empty yet there were no greeters at the front desk- there was a huge sign saying \"wait to be seated\" so I waited, waited, waited and I had to flag someone walking past me -trying to ignore me just to ask when is someone going to help me.  They then hesitantly tried to get me seated.  I ordered a house burger and some soda. Soda came right away, I was thirsty so I drank it right away.  The burger never came.  I was sitting there for 30 minutes watching people get their food, waiters going past me (not offering to refill my drink) or ask me if I got my food.  I asked my waiter and I they finally got alerted that I haven\\'t gotten my food yet.  At that time, I already had to leave.  So I took it to go.  To make matters worse, I ate the burger at work and it tasted overcooked and disgusting overall. Will not come back, do not recommend. We order here frequently the business I work for and they consistently get the order wrong and when I tell them they consistently give an attitude.  Grouchy bunch who gives you the wrong order.  No more Rittenhouse Deli for me. Typical Rita\\'s. Could use some outdoor seating. They hand you the Italian ice through the window and its like, \"ok, get in your car and go now.\" Food was OK, but business forgot an item and apparently overcharged for what was ordered including dessert which should have been comped. Also, the itemized receipt does not indicate prices; we had to go refer to menu to see exactly what we were charged for. Employees are rude and rushed me through my order two different times on the phone, and you must have a car because they \"won\\'t let their drivers\" travel more than a 7-10 minute car ride for delivery, but that\\'s not even the biggest problem. Just a tip for you guys, food automatically tastes worse when it comes from rude people. I came in here looking for some great BBQ closer to Conshohocken. I ordered a little of everything, took forever to get my stuff and I also noticed the menu is quite similar to another place in the area that was around for a while longer. The similarities stop at the descriptions this is not like the other good BBQs in the area. The food seemed prepard in a crock pot or roasting pan, not a smoker. it was luke warm at best and not very flavorful.  The BBQ sauce tasted like a blend of Dijon mustard and bottled sauces, not that tasty.  The worst part was I didn\\'t taste anything that had a smoke flavor at all... I\\'ll either go into Philly or farther down 422 to Pottstown next time... Look around, there\\'s better. Mice in dining room.  Staff is not professional at all; why do I care to listen to stories of their personal drug, alcohol and relationship problems.  Pizza sucked.  Stay away, far, far away.  Enjoy a decent meal in downtown Jenkintown, and for pizza, you\\'d be better off with Dominoes! Fench onion soup with no salt and barely melted cheese.  Raw zuchinis cut into every shape possible, half raw onions on top of chicken.  The table was washes in front of us and the promissed booth was not even close ro beinf clean. I will have to pass this location by in the future. DO NOT DO THEIR DELIVERY!! When I went there for dinner I was beyond amazed at how delicious their tikka masala and lamb curry were as well as the service. Hence why I wanted again. However, my second experience with it via delivery was the worst! Not only was it an hour and a half wait but my food was cold, which doesn\\'t bode well when part of your order included fried foods. When I called them they did not seem to have any sense of how late it was. Lesson learned. I have to start out by saying that I\\'m a WCU alumni and spent many-a nights at Ryan\\'s in the early 2000s. It\\'s funny how a place like Ryan\\'s was considered the \"expensive night out\" when you were in college. Trying to relieve our glory days, we went to Ryan\\'s to grab some food and a few drinks. While the beer tasted the same, the food and service was pretty awful.\\n\\nAs an Italian I was offended when my friend\\'s fried calamari came with shredded parmesan cheese on top. That\\'s violation 101. It is an Irish bar, after all. The cheese steak, the chicken blt sandwich, and the cesar salad were all pretty bad. \\n\\nRyan\\'s does have good wings, and they have a wing special every Wednesday. My (formerly) pregnant sister can attest to that.\\n\\nIf you\\'re in town and looking for a decent dinner, hit Ryan\\'s for a beer before or after, head somewhere else to eat. Pretty excited to try this new place. Well I got deliver by a guy in a bike. After they charge $4.99 for delivery. All the food was cold and a mush. Pork salty , beans too bland not ordering from this place again. I love German food, but  I don\\'t love the food they serve at Brauhaus Schmitz.  I could only manage a bite of the wiener schnitzel.  The fries were overcooked.  The goulash was too salty.  The bratwurst was dry and the flavor was off.  The only decent thing was the fried potatoes. Some slob drinking whiskey at the bar at 11am decided to shame me for looking at the brunch menu and not staying to eat. \"What\\'s wrong, nothing on the menu you like?\" Unfortunately, this bar continues to disappoint. No happy hour, overpriced bad-to-mediocre food and now presumptuous a-holes. Expectations are always fairly low with establishments like this - massive quantities of food they are making with short amount of delivery time, but this is truly the worst Panera I have ever been to. EVERY (no exaggeration) time I have went here my order has either been incorrect, took 20 mins to make a salad, or was completely forgotten about. This morning I ordered a bagel, not toasted, just cut, and cream cheese. Cashier forgot the cream cheese. For the love of all things holy please re-train your staff or hire an entire new one. Waiting about 25 minutes service is lousy and food too we should have got our money back They aren\\'t brewing beer yet, so I can\\'t speak to that yet, as long as they brew it like they did at their old location, they should be ok. \\n\\nThe service was great, but the food, not so much. I found the burger to be mushy and unappetizing- the large globs of goat cheese, mound of caramelized onions and grilled pineapple made it a wet mess.  My kid had the chicken fingers which were so over fried they were hard. \\n\\nAt least upstairs, they lost the ambience the old location. We found it to be sterile, and the bright lights were annoying.  \\n\\nStick by the bar and have the beer, skip the food. Went to dinner for the first time, were greeted very polite by the host. When we sat down the server asked us if this was our first time we said yes and she froze saying nothing. We ordered the salt and pepper shrimp when it came there was no shrimp it was mostly the crusted breading the food had a very good taste then came the \"main course or as they call it plate\" it was the same size as the appetizer I asked \" is this the main course ? \" then we were told that their concept was half size portions. I wish the server had the knowledge about the concept she had no idea of it or the ingredients of what we had. The servers looked very insecure and nervous the looked like they were walking on eggshells.\\nWe found the prices to be quite high.\\nThis is a tapas place good tasting food kind of boring service Received a dry, no flavor, tough bread cheesesteak.  The fries looked like and tasted like end of the day, dark brown oiled fries where the oil needed to be changed probably a few hours back. Lazy.  Charge too much for this crap.  Go somewhere else people.  Plenty of other food options. DO NOT order grubhub from these guys! An hour after no food, I called and was told \"the driver who accepted never came and we don\\'t know how to handle that, so you need to call Grubhub.\" I made reservations in mid-October for a 15-person dinner a couple of weeks before Christmas.  At the time I made the reservations, I was told that we could choose from an a la carte menu or from several different tasting menus.  Two weeks before the event, I received a call saying that they were going to cancel my reservation unless they heard back from me within 24 hours.  Upon calling back, I was informed by Jimmy, the proprietor, that we were being forced to chose from three banquet menus. My husband and I both spoke to the Jimmy, who was very condescending and basically told us to F*** off ... take it or leave it, even though we had made the reservations two months prior and were told that we could eat whatever we wanted.   Since it was so close to the event and we could not get reservations for such a large party on a Saturday night, we kept the reservation.  When the group of 15 people arrived, we were shoved into a corner of the restaurant around a table meant for 8.  It was so crowded that the people on the end just about had to hold their plates in their laps.  The chairs were jammed so close together there was not an inch between them.  Even though we could only choose from 5 entrees, the food took an hour and a half to come out.\\n\\nThe proprietor is rude and obnoxious and obviously doesn\\'t give a bit of care about patrons.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, ever, especially not for a large group event.  If I could give it zero stars, I would. What happened to your burgers?? Used to be these great fresh turkey patties?? Now it\\'s a frozen thing:( I\\'m really disappointed. I\\'ve had lunch here before, and it was delicious and satisfying. We were the first to arrive, and we weren\\'t greeted very nicely. The standard, \"How are you? Do you have a reservation?\" It was literally empty until we were finishing up our meal, so that was interesting.\\n\\nWe were told of a tasting menu with wine pairing, but it was 10:45 and we hadn\\'t had any coffee yet! We promptly ordered some, and when it came out, it was a let down. It wasn\\'t very good in any way and our server didn\\'t ask if we wanted more. \\n\\nWe ordered the spicy potatoes to share and I got the Esprragos Con Trufas, which looked beautiful, but wasn\\'t a powerfully flavored experience. It DID have the most beautifully, elegantly executed poached egg, though.\\n\\nMy honey for the Galletas Y Salsa, which was just okay. I had a bite, and those flavors were far more interesting than my plate. It may be because I didn\\'t consume the crisp with my dish? It just wasn\\'t anything special. The ambience was nice, I guess, but the service wasn\\'t great, either. It was okay, but I had a far better experience my first time, which was during a busy lunch hour. I must say I can\\'t believe that Yelpers have rated this the top Indian restaurant in Philadelphia.  We went there recently on a busy Sunday night and a) the service was comically inept; b) the food (buffet) passable at best; and c) the prices higher than they oughta be.  Am I missing something here, folks? Have not tired the food but arrived late on a Friday. The beer list was solid but nothing seemed too special ( might have been different if I went during happy hour). But what will never bring me back are the bartenders. Our bartender acted as if we were an inconvenience to her for to serve drinks on a night that was not busy. Both girls working seemed like they really had no intention to provide any sort of service so we left. Ordered an iPa which was solid but the G&t was weak and in a plastic cup with poor presentation for the price. Maybe this was just a bad night, but the lack of service won\\'t bring me back especially when there are so many other great establishments in the area. Really nothing made this place Stick out food or drink wise. The service here is poor at best. My food was... ok but took 45 minutes to get to me, it was not busy. I will not be back here, nor do I sugest you visit this poor excuse for a KFC. Over priced, average tasting with pretentious owners (specifically the brunette)\\n\\nI came here a few times when I used to live in Philly a few years ago. I remember asking the owner (brunette) about calorie counts and to this day I won\\'t forget her incredibly arrogant response, \"I eat this stuff all the time and women would kill to have my body\" followed by a dismissive \"do you know what your want?\" Really? That is NOT how you talk to customers. Oh and i never found out the calorie count. I don\\'t know if that\\'s changed since I lived in Philly but this owners arrogance and lack of warmth alone were enough to turn me off from coming here again. Couple that with expensive meh-tasting food and no thank you. \\n\\nUnfortunate too because I actually do have food allergies but I\\'d rather save my appetite and money for an establishment that treats it\\'s customers with more respect.\\n\\nPS your body was nothing to write home about Terrible customer service. Our server didn\\'t speak English which made ordering very difficult. Dinning room floor was full of crumbs and food scraps. We were crunched for time so we asked to get the order to go. After leaving we noticed one of the meals was replaced with white rice. Another one of the orders was the wrong type of soup all together. If I could give less than one start I would. Avoid at all costs! Hummus republic has the worst fries I\\'ve ever had in my life. Even bad fries can be edible but I\\'m not sure these were. Soaked in grease, the one I had seemed undercooked but some fries were dried out. Clearly they have been sitting out and I\\'m not sure why they would even serve them at this point. We ordered street fries. It wasnt until after they put the fries in the box and we asked if anything goes on top of the fries, that they told us they didnt have them. This is odd considering the salad we ordered contained all of the ingredients that go on top of the street fries. Another customer was also told they didn\\'t have them as well. \\n\\nThe build your own salad is okay. With so many better options for similar food in this area, I\\'m not sure why anyone would go here. Two stars because the food was edible and the service was on point. I say \"edible\" because, to my knowledge, I wasn\\'t poisoned and was able to chew and swallow the food to give sustenance to my body. My cheesesteak omelet was both overcooked and woefully short on both meat and cheese. It looked and ate like a 6 dollar omelet. It cost 10, unfortunately. My girlfriend\\'s meal was worse. The only thing that distracted her from how soggy and bland her crab and tomato omelet was, was the orgy of houseflies taking place around our heads. She kept salting her food to no avail, partially deterred by the Amazon-like heat and humidity inside the restaurant. Sausage and bacon was passable but by no means anything special. This place might have been great at one time, but fucking up simple breakfast fare doesn\\'t bode well for a diner\\'s future. I have patronized Hope\\'s Cookies for years and am generally satisfied with the product.  On several occasions, however, I bought cookies which were touted as fresh.  I got them en route to a function so there is no reason the cookies should have been stale.  Stale they were and  red-faced was I.    They have a good product but the quality assurance is lacking. I wanted to like Elevation. The staff was friendly. The place was clean. The cows (I imagine) were happy cows that frolicked in a field and listened to cool music. They offer milkshakes, which are the achilles heel for Five Guys, IMO.\\n\\nBUT... the burger was dry. Plain and simple dry. Grass fed has less fat, people. Learn to cook the thing properly, please? I assume this may have been an anomaly, but there is little grey area when it comes to a burger joint improperly cooking a burger. You cook hundreds a day, and you know when you have cooked one too long. Shame on you for trying to feed me it.\\n\\nFries cooked in olive oil are healthier for me, right? No thanks, save the healthy and give me thicker cut fries with more flavor than a napkin! Maybe some folks like the shoesting fries. I find them less appealing. To each their own.. but you all know I am right. I couldn\\'t believe how overrated this place was. I\\'ve had better middle eastern food from a dirty street vendor. I got the eggplant pita wrap and it was drenched in a thick, unpleasant yellow sauce. The eggplant was soggy and piping hot which effectively steamed the whole thing and sogged out the entire pita. One in my party got the special that night (which both facebook and the waitress were pushing) and he had better luck with it, but overall the regular menu lacks finesse. Big letdown, and I wouldn\\'t go back. Stopped in for quick drinks and apps and was not impressed as a first time patron. You figure the service would be decent seeing as the bar was not busy at for 6PM on a Saturday and two folks tending to it, but guess again. We were lost in translation with one bartender and never really saw the other. We did an order of oysters (so-so), calamari (cold and flavorless), clams casino (not bad). Sub par service and food on a quick visit is enough for me to not want to even think about dining here. Pretty frustrated here. I love yards beer, but the customer service at their tap room is rude and unfriendly. I went on a Saturday night looking to relax and have a beer. I was greeted by a bouncer that demanded my ID, generally not a problem. His condescending tone when I presented it to him was. When I go to an establishment I expect to be treated with respect this guy had no respect at all. After that I went the very crowded bar to try to get a beer, the bartenders were engrossed in several conversations and not paying attention to the bar at all. After waiting ten minutes and not even seeing a bartender acknowledge my presence I decided to cut my losses and leave. I might drink a yards beer from time to time but I will never be back to this bar. Made a reservation on last day of restaurant week ! Arrived 10 mins late because we had to look for parking. I came in and waited for 6-7 mins before a hostess appeared. Confirmed my reservation and her exact words \"You\\'re lucky that you made it before the cut off time when we stop accepting customers\". Ohhh geez, I didn\\'t know I was going to an interview appt and had to be appreciative that I made it before the cut off time. Anyways, we got seated and the waiter came to explain the difference between restaurant week option and the original menu option. My bf and I needed time to figure out what type of selection we wanted to receive and the waiter kept interrupting us to make a decision. so we went with the original menu ~60$ per person. Half way through our meals, waiter disappeared and only the chiefs that came out with the meats served us. Even when we were finished, waiter was no where to be found but luckily another server helped take our bills. \\n\\nIn terms of food quality; side dishes were good but the meat was VERY AVERAGE. even the filet mignon and the lamb chop, both very dry (considered their top meats). The chicken and sausages were not too bad. Overall, our experience was not quite impressive and disappointing since there was so much \"HYPE\" about this place. If you want a completely rude and obnoxious bartender, then this is the place for you.  Short, brunette.  We went into an empty restaurant.  We asked if she could put on football, she continued to slam glasses and bottles around.  She was clearly in a bad mood.  60 Minutes was on (again nobody there) and she wouldn\\'t change the station.  When we politely expressed our concerns to the manager, she stated, \"Well she\\'s YOUR bartender and what she says goes\" and became very combative.  We continued to eat our meal (penne with vodka sauce) which was dry and terrible.  We couldn\\'t even eat it.   When we got up to leave , bartender started laughing at us hysterically.  Wow. Ordered take out. Got sass from the waitress checking me out for no reason. The sushi was alright but nothing to write home about, except that all three orders were jam packed into one container. The agedashi tofu was AWFUL. The only redeeming thing I can think of was the side of sushi rice and the fact that I had a 10% off coupon. I will be looking for another sushi place next time. My husband and I were here on Saturday morning. Horrible service, over roasted coffee and over cooked breakfast burrito. So disappointed in this place. Will not be back. Beautiful space and a much needed addition to the area.\\n\\nThat said both my father and I were sick after eating the fried chicken I ordered from here. I began eating it when I realized one piece had blood coming out of it. Instead of removing the item from our bill the manager only offered free desert. I wont be back. If it were possible to give this place zero stars, I would. Arrived on time for our reservation, but the table wasn\\'t ready. There\\'s really no place to wait for your table, so the very, very rude manager/owner yelled at us for \"blocking the door\" and told us to go outside and wait IN THE SNOW. After waiting for more than 45 minutes (past our scheduled reservation), the 7 of us were finally crammed into a table for four. The manager/owner continued to snap at our every request - like our totally ridiculous request to get menus and water after sitting at the table for 15 minutes. So demanding, right? The waitstaff did their best to apologize for his nastiness, but he was so miserable it put a bit of a damper on the meal. The food was barely even close to average; portions were small; our dinners all came out at different times (almost 10 minutes later for some); and three of our dinners were wrong. All around, just an unbelievably awful place. We thought we were being punked. I love Chipotle and go to the ones downtown regularly. I went to this location today because I happened to be in West Oak Lane. As soon as I walked in, I saw a handwritten sign stating the store was out of queso and sour cream. Wth? So, I go and get a burrito bowel. I ended up getting a burrito bowl. They didn\\'t have anymore fajita veggies so I had to take the one at the bottom of the pan. The serving area was a mess and the kitchen area behind it was too. The seating area was also dirty and something bizarre is going on with the construction of the floor. \\n\\nWhen I got to the register, a woman asked the cashier for a tray. The young man looked through a small stack of trays that were all dirty. Instead of cleaning the trays, the cashier wiped one off with his hands as we both looked on in shock. The woman declined the tray and simply walked to her table. \\n\\nBy this point, I was so annoyed that I asked for a Manager. The young man was accommodating and offered us a free coupon for our next visit. I appreciated his effort, but this place needs more help than one Manager could possibly do on their own. It\\'s ok. Over priced and the food isn\\'t good enough to make up for the standoffish people that work there. \\n\\nGot questions? Save it. Want something taken out of your $15 soup? Nope or get ready to have a hard time. \\n\\nWaiting for one friend to join your party when the restaurants empty? They won\\'t sit you. You can sit at the bar, which you will also be given a hard time about. Or stand around. In that you do have a choice. \\n\\nWhile I understand not seating a party till everyone\\'s present, the same table would be used for 3 than for 4. These are just little \\'details\\' when it comes to customer service that makes the difference between me wanting to come back or not. In this case, the quality of food does not outweigh the crappy service. On a scale of \"not worth it\" to \"I\\'d come back if someone else foots the bill\" I\\'m inclined to not come back even if someone else covered the bill.\\n\\n-update\\n\\nSo this was an unpublished review for some time and now incorporates 2 visits worth of horrible service. There is only ONE good waiter there. I wish I knew his name! I forgot an item at the store, called back and she said she was putting me on hold.. and didn\\'t. I heard her ask the other girl for my item and then \"oh tell her it isn\\'t here\". Are. You. Kidding. Me? My missing item is there but she wanted to tell me it wasn\\'t so they could keep it? Never again. I returned after one horrible experience because it was my friend\\'s birthday to be left with an even worse opinion. Great bookstore but seating sucks!!! The cafe is always packed even though there is a 30 min limit. And upstairs is worse. Packed in uncomfortable seats with strangers is not how I want to spread my reading time. And if there is an event they will tell you to move elsewhere, which leaves you back into the crowded cafe or buy the book and go home! Don\\'t bother trying to sit on the floor cause a rude security guard will tell you to move. I understand that their ultimate goal is to make the sale and for you to leave but if that\\'s the case then maybe they shouldn\\'t offer a cafe or seating at all.  They bettermake up their minds to add more seating or none at all cause they are gonna lose a lot of customers! Let\\'s start with the address being incorrect on this Yelp page.\\n\\nPulse Hookah Lounge was completely unprofessional during my most recent visit. An event was booked for my good friend to celebrate the release of their album. To make a long story short, his event did not start until almost 2 hrs later from which it was originally scheduled. Then, by 2am the house DJ basically ended the event, so they could have their normal activities. These guys paid money for this spot, worked hard for their music to be showcased and brought a nice crowd to Pulse Hookah Lounge to be disrespected numerous times. I understand that mistakes like double booking happen, but Pulse hookah lounge should have handled things differently. \\n\\nI can\\'t tell you what to do,  but until they hire an event coordinator, I would not recommend renting out this space. For your hookah entertainment, I would say go for it. But they lost me with the other BS.\\n\\nPulse in the future, I hope you will conduct business a little differently. I have to say I\\'m pretty disappointed that I came in loving the venue.  I made a reservation and when I came in the hostess said I would have to wait 15 min to be seated and seemed a little unorganized.  Not a big deal went to the bar where the problems really started.  I was with my girlfriend and I already caught it but it seemed that the one bartender was unprofessional heard him cursing and talking about strange things and even displayed bad practices.  Expect a bartender to be talking and acting this way at a corner bar somewhere.  There was a full bar and the one bartender seemed to let the other one off early or actually just work as a barback.  Service definitely was being affected because now the one bartender was serving the bar and had to deal with all the service tickets.  I even heard that the other bar tender say he would stay on.  When my table was ready it took a long time for me to attempt to get my check closed.   \\n\\nI would say out of the things that we ordered the steak was most reasonably priced.  Steak I found to be a bit tough even though I ordered mine medium rare.  Server also mess up our coursing which was strange because we ordered 1-2 courses first then we decided on the main course and somehow our main course came out before course 2.  Not a big deal for me and the server was very apologetic and nice.  \\n\\nAll and all left there exactly what 2 stars describes \"Meh\". Ehhh, I won\\'t be back.  Kind of a weird atmosphere.  Too many servers hanging over our shoulders, and a definite elitist vibe.  Plus, everything was super salty.  Aside from being salty, it was good, but not really worth the money.  Definitely a disappointment.  So much that I\\'m writing in fragments. Had a reservation and went with a large group. Food was good, not exceptional by any means and server was very attentive. Everything going well, until as we were figuring out check, owner approached table. He asked how meal was and made small talk. Then he tells us that others are waiting and we needed to LEAVE. LEAVE. We were only there an hour-an hour and half tops! I have never been in a restaurant where they ask you to leave. My jaw was on the floor. I would NEVER go back and would advise anyone who considers going here to read the reviews because apparently this is the norm for this guy. HORRIBLE. I would not recommend this place for brunch. First we were seated at a rocky table, it doesn\\'t even stay in place as we eating our food. Their coffee is probably the worst coffee I ever had. I am pretty positive the waitress gave us bad cream because it tasted very sour. The food is also not that good. I don\\'t think I will ever come back The last few times I\\'ve stopped in pei Wei has been a disappointment. I come quite often but the last time I came they didn\\'t have any chicken or shrimp. Tonight I wanted to try the blazing Bangkok chicken dish an they didn\\'t have enough sauce to prepare it so I opted for the chicken pad Thai an got my boyfriend the chicken chow Mein. I don\\'t understand why they prepare the chicken two different ways with a noodle dish my chicken was nice an soft an my boyfriends chicken was fried hard as a rock. Secondly this is the worst pad Thai I\\'ve gotten from there it\\'s dry as the Sahara desert an has no veggies/onions. The Chow Mein I asked for no carrots an it has carrots anyway which I kinda of knew by the reaction of the guys face as if he messed something up but of course he didn\\'t say anything an I didn\\'t notice til I got home. There never seems to be any mgmt in this place everyone kind of does whatever they feel like it\\'s getting on my nerves gonna have to find a new place to eat at Man was this place disappointing. Very average service, really average food and not a good atmosphere. My burger (because the menu was not to my liking, was overcooked and tasteless.\\nFeels like a chain. Yuck. I will never order from here again. My food was 25 minutes late and when I got outside I discovered they had forgotten part of my order. When I got home I discovered a piece of hair on my roll and that the eel on another roll hadn\\'t been deboned. I called grub hub who contacted the restaurant to issue a refund. They declined because they had given me free fried broccoli. I didn\\'t want the broccoli and it didn\\'t change the horrible quality of the rolls. Grubhub ended up issuing me a refund which is good because I ended up reordering a meal from somewhere else. Italian food seems to be a dime a dozen so there is no reason not to be picky. With that said, this place was average at best. The bread served was cold and borderline stale- it just fell very short. One of the recommended dishes was the veal saltimbocca but it was just okay. I felt it was a little salty and a little bit brand. It was over potatoes but there was really nothing special about it.\\n\\nI realize that we came on a week night but it was really dead and there was really no atmosphere to this place. It left me with a lot to desire and probably not a place i would seek out. I\\'ve been to my fair share of buffets. Good price?  Yeah. The food is good. The dessert bar is horrible. The cheesecake is a sad excuse for cheesecake. More cake less cheese. The chocolate was barely edible. There is always an obnoxious group of people that hover over the crab area. So unless it\\'s a quiet night don\\'t expect any of them unless you feel like waiting for the next batch to come out. Selection is decent but doesn\\'t change much. Something for the picky eaters. Sushi, soup, salad. This is my second time ordering from this restaurant. The food has been pretty quality, but the customer service was terrible this time around. The delivery man was incredibly rude, and I was in disbelief. When I answered the door, I was going through my wallet for cash so I could pay the man and tip him. He very brashly and condescendingly said, \"Well, are you gonna take the bag or something?\" talking about my food which he was still holding...for only 5 seconds, if that. While it\\'s not the worst that could happen, there is absolutely no reason for him to have treated me that way. Not sure if I\\'ll be ordering from this establishment again. Avoid at all costs!!! (especially on Friday and Saturday evenings after 8 p.m.) Local hang out spot for a ton of bad drivers with bad attitudes in their horrible cars. I would know. I\\'m one of them. Crowded areas filled with \"Honda heads\" usually attract ignorant people wanting to do burn-outs, donuts and wheelies. Food is horrible and over-priced. Drinks are unique. EXTREMELY slow drive-thru only after certain hour. Sadly my 4 stars has become a 2.  My past 2 experiences at this location have been bad.  Although the menu is great my food was bland.  I threw a greek chicken pita out after 2 bites & do not go close to closing for soup as you will still wait and it will just be a bowl of broth (with little flavor. a bouillion cube at home would be better) & a sprinkling of some items they threw in and microwaved.  Horrible! This used to be one of my fave go to breakfast joints. Friendly staff and great breakfast. Haven\\'t been in awhile due to job change and was excited when errands took me back to WC. Waitresses still friendly, but breakfast was horrible-inedible. When the waitress stopped by and asked me how everything was, I told her that it was not good, very disappointing. It was pretty evident bc I hardly touched the food. The eggs were watery, the potatoes under cooked (as in still hard, raw). Her response was, \"I\\'m sorry\". -- at least with a smile. That was it. \\n\\nI wish I had thought to take a pic of my plate so Yelpers could see how bad this was. \\n\\nWhen I went to pay. I was asked again. \"How was everything?\"  Again, I told her. I don\\'t like to make a scene in restaurants, but honestly I didn\\'t expect to pay for my meal. My iced was fine and I was ok to pay for it. The cashiers response was \"I\\'m sorry, hopefully you\\'ll have a better experience next time\". Sorry,  Penn\\'s Table, you don\\'t really care about your customer. I will not be entering your restaurant again. I liked the Reese\\'s frozen yogurt but the water ice literally tasted like water. Perhaps I have been spoiled by Rita\\'s water ice but this was just as expensive and hardly as good. Made the trek because it said they were open for another hour online but they were already locked up and mopping when we got there Branzino is a quaint BYOB in Rittenhouse, and I really wanted to like it but the food was sub-par. I ordered Tuna Carpacio that was sliced so thin I had to scrape it off the plate. For my entree, I had Squash Ravioli (a house favorite) that had a flavor similar to chicken broth and was very small portion wise, I think there were 5 raviolis. The rest of my party also reported less than average meals. High points were the mussels as an app. and the deserts were pretty good. Service was good, our waiter was very accommodating, however we were seated outside and asked several times for the heaters to be turned on and they never were and it was very dark (and difficult to read the menus). Overall I wouldn\\'t avoid the place, but I probably wouldn\\'t go back soon. We came in for a nice lunch on a rainy Labor Day yesterday with a friend.  We figured it was a good day to catch up and enjoy a good leisurely lunch.  I always enjoy the food here.  Every.  Single.  Time!  However, it\\'s typically the staff that irritates me.  We had a reservation and were told we\\'d have to wait 20 minutes.  Ok, they must be busy!!!  Each time this happens they have empty tables all over the place.  Yesterday there were 7 tables empty while we waited (a previous occasion there were 10+).  So we waited.  After about 25 minutes of waiting I asked how much longer.  She told me she was waiting for us to check back.  Really?  We checked in.  You said 20 minutes.  You took our # AND we were standing less than 5 feet from you the entire time.  She immediately sat us when I pointed this all out to her.  The other thing that really bothered me was the people that were waiting were deciding to just sit @ empty tables.  The didn\\'t expect service (nor did they get it) but they decided to sit.  Purses hands etc were all over bread plates, silverware and napkins.  Um, when I go to any restaurant I expect the table to be CLEAN and not handled by a random stranger after who knows what they\\'ve touched.  The staff should have never allowed this or at minimum removed everything from the table, wiped it down and re-set it with clean utensils, dishes and napkins.  Not at all what I\\'d expect from this place. i was unimpressed on many levels, starting with walking through the door to inhale a dirty diaper smell. decor\\'s fine, simple, pretty colors. it was packed but they found a table for us. the menu was worded in such a way that not much called out to me, but all i could get was the striped bass anyway. service was a tad slow but i attributed this to them being packed. also food took over 30 mins to arrive. normally this would be fine but we were in a hurry, so i was a bit irritated. the kitchen staff seemed way too small for the size of the restaurant. i counted 2 in the kitchen and 2 servers.\\nanyway food came and it was obvious that something was bad. more of that dirty diaper smell. i have a very sensitive nose, but even my dining partner noticed it when the food came (i believe the word she used was \"gnarly\"). we narrowed it down to the piece of fish, which i did not eat more than a couple bites of. the concept of the dish was great - some couscous with fun little tomatoes and pretty herbs and mussels. just the execution of it didn\\'t work because of the bad fish. didn\\'t bother sending it back because we were way late for a show at the tin angel anyway. we chalked it up to live and learn, and hit the road. for what its worth, though i didn\\'t try it, my dining companion had short rib, which she said was fine but not as tender as a recent short rib dish she had at parc. I hadn\\'t been to this restaurant for a number of years. It used to be a nice place to spend an evening. Well, this time I was told the chef had just introduced a new menu. I\\'ve no problem with that except apparently it meant that, from the time we sat down to the time dinner came to the table, two hours had passed. Yes, TWO solid hours. The wait staff did not seem that concerned but, after I complained, they said there would be no charge for dessert. I indicated that was not sufficient and, when they brought the check, they did give us a sizeable discount. But TWO hours? And the food was not very hot when they did finally serve it. We will not be going back! just returned from my trip on the spirit of philadelphia and i must say, it sorta broke my spirit.\\n\\nnow, i\\'ll excuse the fact that i wasn\\'t aware my ticket didn\\'t include open bar.  i\\'ll even excuse the unorganized half-buffet, half-waited dinner.  the food was mediocre at best, but what can you expect? i\\'ve been on these kinds of dinner/party cruises before.\\n\\nwhat i cannot excuse was the strange policing of the dance floor (this was a private party), the horrible dj, the incredibly overpriced booze, and the brusque and sarcastic waitress.  no thanks.  there was no fun to be had except to chug the overpriced booze and wait to hit the harbor again.  luckily it was a nice night out so escape was possible in stints on the balcony.\\n\\ni would never choose to go on one of these myself.  better off have fun on your own, buy booze elsewhere, not be on a boat.  all the boat does is go up and down the same short stretch of river anyway.  do yourself a favor - save yourself the money and go get a far better boozey brunch on land. I think I am done with Suburbia unfortunately.  Workers are great and extremely helpful.  This; however, was the first time I had ever been in the location.  Location is a bit tricky/trecherous to get into.  Tucked in the back corner of Bridgeport, it is easy to miss.  The inside is dark and very dated.  What killed it for me was the smell.  Granted, any seafood place has that special smell of raw fish and crustaceans.  This smell was off unfortunately.  I worried about it more 3minutes later when a very obvious smell of Glade/Frebreeze became thick in the air.  The cooked food ordered was good and fresh.  I bought crab claws as a treat; however, I will be throwing it away as the funky \"off\" smell is in the bag.  The smell was in the bag of condiments as well.  Makes me very leary of getting things in the future. I\\'ve always had a good experience at this place until recently. I\\'m a really shy person as well as hard of hearing... so at one point the bartender refuse to serve me because he thought I appeared intoxicated. Which again, I understand because with me being partially deaf, people mistake the way I speak as slurring my words when it\\'s more of a speech impediment and I guess it is my fault for having my hair down and covering my hearing aids. But when my friend and  explained to the manager that I am hard of hearing/shy and not drunk, they didn\\'t seem to comprehend why I was embarrassed more than anything. I 100% understand that the manager I spoke to would have the bartender\\'s back, as one should, it was just a little disappointing that she didn\\'t empathize where I was coming from. We just returned from a\"Restaurant Week\" dinner at Harp & Crown.\\nThe physical layout is very nice although there are areas where people are really on top of each other to squeeze more people in.\\nWe were told that unlike other restaurants for restaurant week, Harp  and Crown allows anything on the menu/ i.e. appetizer,entre, but no dessert, as we sadly found out.  Something was lost in translation with  the waiter, because we ordered JUST THAT. All that we thought was allowed for $35.00-  The waiter told us that this would normally be a $45.00 dinner.\\nIt was only after our meal, when the check came, that we saw there was no RESTAURANT WEEK accomodation at all. We were charged exactly what the bill would have been on a  regular night. That was disappointing to say the least. It was AFTER we got our check that the waiter explained that it was only the items on the sides of the menu that were on restaurant week.  Duh.\\nWhy in the world, since there are so many items on the menu that they could  not print up a special menu  for restaurant week.  \\nWe saw our waiter again explaining the menu to others who  also had blank looks on their faces.\\nThe food was OK but I wouldn\\'t even begin to rate the food because the policy was so screwed up.\\nPeople hate feel \"had.\"\\nFor that reason, we would not return.  We don\\'t play games and neither should the  restaurant. If you are someone who enjoys chaotic loud busy bar type restaurants, then you may like it here. Not my cup of tea personally. Food was fine, ordered boneless wings. Waitress was tending to too many tasks... forgot our silverware after offering, we wound up asking another waitress. Probably wouldn\\'t go back. Dirty, filthy, smelly and not just the bathroom! We walked in to a rush of foul stench of unknown origin. The staff was very young and a bit dazed. Months have passed and they still have not fixed the massive broken window pasted over with cardboard and a silly sign saying \"hidden flavors.\"  Really?  Gelato was just ok, nothing special, and yes I have had tons including all over Italy. What happened? Have been a few times prior... decent food good atmosphere for groups. Decided to head over on a Wednesday night for some tacos and margaritas. Very understaffed, appeared that the waitstaff may also be new. Nice enough but very slow. As time passed the place go busier waited 30 plus minutes for drinks and 45 minutes from the time we sat till appetizer came. I can always over look new staff and unexpected crowds. My issue was with the manager, apparently our waiter sensed our dissatisfaction, he must have mentioned it to the manager who approached our table and asked if everything was ok, my husband mentioned how busy and that it appeared unstaffed and his reply was \" it is what it is... what can I do\" I was shocked. I honestly couldn\\'t believe his response. No attempt for service recovery he just walked away. We felt bad for the staff as this was their support person who basically seemed unsympathetic to the situation. We won\\'t be returning... things happen, we get that... tipped the waiter well as he wasn\\'t responsible for the situation and was drowning. But the managers response was disgraceful for someone in service, that I cannot overlook. Went in for lunch. Ordered a bacon cheeseburger with fries, coleslaw and a pickle. There was a hair in my fries. The waitress talked to the manager and came back. He hadn\\'t told her to do anything. By this point, I did not want replacement fries. She told us she would talk with the manager again because of his lack of doing anything about it. She came back and said he would offer a dessert on the house, which we did not want. He looked over at us, never came to apologize and seemed to hide from us. As we went to pay our check he was no longer at the register and a child handled our check. Never going back. Went there with very high expectations - but left underwhelmed. Food was not flavorful - standard slightly bland overpriced Indian food. Maybe it was on off day .. but I wont come back again. Totally overpriced for very underwhelming food. The servers presented the wrong dishes, substituted items without informing us, and then charged for what we didn\\'t ask for. We were robbed of both money and a good meal. Manager is nasty, and went out of her way not resolve the issue and hide behind \"policy\". A policy that seems not to give their guest a pleasant or good experience. Seriously the worst gyro I\\'ve ever had. The pita was hard, the lamb was full of gristle. 2 bites and it went into the bin. I ordered via seamless so sure, the pita issue? Okay. But inedible meat? Nope. $20 later and I\\'m still hungry and feel like an old man died in my mouth. I have had sushi all over the world, some excellent and some completely horrible.  I was expecting quite good for a price of $33 here.\\n\\nI was horribly let down.  Much of the fish tasted very fishy, as if it had been sitting out for quite a while.\\n\\nThe tuna had a definite consistency that indicated it had been frozen and re-thawed multiple times.\\n\\nA few of the rolls were fairly good, but almost everything with raw fish tasted off.  At the price of this I agree with other Yelpers that you can just go to a full service sushi restaurant and get much better quality fish prepared to order.\\n\\nIf you want a crappy asian buffet, save your money and go to Kings Buffet.  If you want Sushi, go to bluefin or another real sushi place.  Don\\'t combine the two. Food totally sucks. Waitress was fine and kept the drinks coming. Thank god because all the food we had was terrible and the bathroom had a huge hole in the stall wall... like that takes 5 mins to patch get your act together Ordered tiger shrimp for takeout-it was bland (I specified spicy) and rubbery-very disappointing. Isn\\'t Philly cheese stake supposed to be as iconic New York pizza? That\\'s what I expected here, but sadly they did not deliver, and I ended up feeling like I\\'d just wasted more than $10 on sub standard take away sandwich. What was the beef? Bland. With onion and provolone, it didn\\'t even taste seasoned = BLAND. Came here for brunch and though the patio was lovely, the service was iffy (slow and unknowledgeable waitress). The food was also bland and my friend\\'s meal come to the table incomplete. It\\'s too bad this place is so hit or miss! Great spot and fun to dance but the service is terrible! Last night, 15 of my closest friends decided to celebrate a friends birthday at this bar. We all paid a $5 cover to get in and headed straight to the bar to grab a drink. The bartenders were extremely rude and it took about 20 mins to get their attention. In particular the bald bartender with the black glasses was extremely rude and made countless comments to me and my friends. When my fiancé an I went to grab our next drink - he ordered a $6 beer and I ordered a $7 lime ricky- the bartender told us it would be $18, without realizing the cost of my drink my fiancé kindly handed him a $20 and told him to keep the change. When I went for my third drink I ordered again my lime Ricky and the bald bartender told me it would be $7. I then realized his mistake on my last order and confronted the bartender about the mistake- he was extremely rude and said their was a \"happy hour\" which on the chalk board had ended before we even arrived at the bar- when I pointed this out to him he called me dumb and laughed in my face.  Later in the night when the bar wasn\\'t as crowded I went to get my friend a water and myself a beer, he wouldn\\'t even look at me and was purposely skipping me, and serving everyone else around me. I finally said something and proceeded to the other side of the bar and was immediately helped by the other bartender working. After telling my friends about this they all agreed to have had similar experiences with the same bartender throughout the night. Again, as I said fun place but after paying a cover and bringing 15 friends to the bar I am extremely disappointed in the way my friends and I were treated. My boyfriend and I went to dinner tonight and were very disappointed. We have gone here other times and had a great meal. Tonight, we sent back a dish twice and it was still not correct. He ordered a burrito with very simple instruction to leave out the lettuce, tomato and onion. The first time it came loaded with all three. The waitress took the order again, even asked me for confirmation. She even laid the order on the table for us to review it! It clearly said no pico, lettuce or onion! The second burrito came out loaded with lettuce! She never came back to the table to see if everything was ok. She was not friendly and did not seem to care whether we got what we asked for. Sadly, I do not believe we will come back to this restaurant. Where do I even begin? I came here during lunch with my friend to pick up a \"quick treat.\" I ordered the 3 Leches gourmet churro and my friend ordered the Galletas Abue. \\n\\nWe waited a whole 30 minutes for our order, while people who ordered after us received their food. There were only 3 people working, which makes sense, but doesn\\'t excuse the issue altogether. \\n\\nWhen we got our churros, there was nothing special to them. The churros itself were undercooked and flavorless. I did not receive vanilla bean or meringue as described and both orders DID NOT come with soft serve vanilla ice cream as the gourmet churro should have.\\n\\nI would have gone back and spoken to the manager, but I had no proof of purchase as my receipt didn\\'t print due to a malfunctioning printer. I\\'m incredibly upset about my experience and would most likely not recommend anyone to go unless you want to feel disappointed. This place has closed now, and good riddance I say. The food was just ok, but it was the staff that ruined this place. Completely incompetent, the absolute WORST. The host here is the rudest host I\\'ve ever seen.... so I decided to go somewhere else Work has been insane for the past few weeks and then today was just non-stop small things.  I thought it was close to lunch time, but then I realized only an hour had passed.  I decided I needed my favorite chocolate chip walnut cookie from Hope\\'s to set things right and put me in a better mood.  As soon as I entered the store, I went over to the cookies and noticed that they looked a lot smaller than usual.  Also, no one looked familiar to me.  I haven\\'t been in here for a bit, due to the renovations at the adjoining snap pizza, so maybe this is Hope\\'s now.  I told the cashier that I wanted my chocolate chip walnut cookie and she was so confused.  She originally picked up a chocolate chip, then an oatmeal, before I told her that it was on the other side.  She grabbed the cookie and the rest of my order.  \\n\\nWhen I got back to the office, I couldn\\'t find my cookie.  Then I saw this one cookie with a few morsels and some nuts, so I thought the quality really went down.  The beauty of the chocolate chip walnut was the overabundance of walnuts and morsels.  I sadly bit into the cookie, only to taste coconut.  She gave me the Almond Joy and that brought no joy to me.  The peanut butter milk chocolate I purchased also tasted a bit burnt.  So disappointing. THe pizza is okay. The people who work here, however, are not.\\n\\nWe were stopping for pizza late on a Saturday night. After waiting for thirty minutes in line, we had finally ordered some slices. A friend of mine put his hand down, and it happened to touch one of the metal pizza trays that was peeking out from below the plastic display case.\\n\\nApparently, touching the metal tray is a crime. The person behind the counter walked up to my friend and told him that he had to leave the store and couldn\\'t have any pizza. When we protested that we didn\\'t do ANYTHING, he then called a bouncer who mans the doors and they threw us out. \\n\\nIf that wasn\\'t bad enough, about three minutes later, the bouncer was escorting another person out who they assumed was with us - we had in fact never seen the guy before. The bouncer pinned the guy up against the wall by the neck and then shoved him as hard as possible out the door. As you can imagine, quite the tumult ensued.\\n\\nLong story short - do not patronize this establishment. Read through the reviews here and you\\'ll see that other people have had a similar experience to my own. There is no reason to support a place that is on such a power trip that they think they can push you around so you can get a semi-okay piece of pizza. Take a stand, people! Dark and dingy inside.. the nachos were burnt and not even edible. Meatloaf was super soggy and tasted like floor cleaner. The waitress was very sweet, but we had to keep asking for things (drink refills after she took our cups away to refill them but never brought them back, straws, bags).. the tater tots were great,  until I moved the dish to share with someone else at the table and there was a bug between the dish and the plate it was served on. Friendly staff, but we won\\'t be back. This place used to be really good when it first opened, I even got a \"frequent burrito\" card and was two burritos away from my freebie....but then, something happened - I don\\'t know whether they went cheap on their items or what, but the quality really changed. \\n\\nI got one more burrito, and never went back. It\\'s a shame, because it was always my stop after a haircut, but sadly, I wouldn\\'t go back. It is inexpensive, it does have a great selection of sauces...but I would hope they\\'ll step it up again in the future....I want them to be back to their old glory! I came here last night with my aunt and uncle. This was our first time here.. First what we noticed the AC wasn\\'t working properly, it was extremely hot in the restaurant. When we got seated they didn\\'t give us all of the menus they only gave us the dinner menu and the wine menu. Our food took a very long time to arrive to us, we had to ASK for bread for our table. The whole experience just wasn\\'t what I thought it would be, being as though Devon\\'s is a really nice restaurant. The food was okay. I\\'m not sure if I\\'ll give this place another try. Dirty windows. Cluttered counter also not super clean or tidy. Not great coffee. Come on get your act together: what a missed opportunity. We live a block away but walk 15 mins away for coffee shop alternatives! Had reservations for 6 @ 6pm - main courses didn\\'t arrive until 7pm. My branzino was tasteless, poorly fileted (lots and lots of bones), and there was barely 2 forkfulls of edible fish. The accompanying veggies were also tasteless. Others in our party had decent meals. Crowded tables & relatively noisy. I\\'ll not be going go back - not worth the wait. Let me preface this by saying it was Mother\\'s Day when we went to dinner here last night. That said we waited an hour for appetizers only to here our waiter say as we finished them that he had just fired our food. That took another 20 minutes.\\n\\nThe food was good. Nothing to inventive, but nothing unpalatable. I had the smoked salmon appetizer and the short ribs as a main. Both were good and I would order again if I found myself in that predicament.\\n\\nThe service was terrible. There was at least 3 servers and 3 bus boys running around the small rooms and they could not manage the floor. \\n\\nI like to think I know when something is not a servers fault, such as your meet being overcooked. This was not one of those times.\\n\\nThere are far better options, for a better price and better service. \\n\\nI wouldn\\'t recommend going here. Was in the mood for a steak while shopping at the Terminal Market, I didn\\'t have high hopes tbh after reading the reviews of this place . I got exactly what the other reviews got , a bland , boring steak. Wasn\\'t bad .. Or good .. Was just meeehhh.. So many better food options at the market that I actually felt stupid for going there . Service was fast and friendly . The sandwich was just dry and boring . Needed more wiz, some type of hot sauce and some cherry peppers .. In other words , it needed to be PAT\\'S.. Lol. I won\\'t be repeating . Had the Korean short rib burrito. It was 90% rice, and 9% cabbage... only 1% meat and kimchi. Okay, I\\'m exaggerating a little. But either way, there was way too much rice, and not nearly enough of the other components to balance it out. On top of that, the short rib was hardly a Korean marinade. Much closer to the stereotypical teriyaki flavor. Overall, disappointed. My experience with Cantina Dos Segundos is like...\\n\\n...that scab you keep picking even though you know it\\'ll leave a scar\\n\\nOR\\n\\n...that moment when you risk the biscuit and double park while trying to get a cheesesteak but end up getting a parking ticket\\n\\nOR\\n\\n....when you text your ex, when you have no business texting your ex\\n\\nOR\\n\\n...when you take that shot to be apart of a cheers with your friends even though you know you blacked out two shots ago\\n\\n\\nTo translate: I keep coming back here hoping/expecting it will get better but it never does. I\\'ve tried different menu options each time and I continue to leave with regret and shame. \\n\\nTonight\\'s episode of, \"How I Realized I\\'m Insane\" was brought to you by their burnt/bland tasting butternut squash soup and their enchilada. The most exciting thing about the enchilada was their side black beans... yeah. \\n\\nI\\'ve wanted to like this place for its location but alas I will officially have to get my Mexican fix somewhere else. If I could rate 0 stars I would. Absolutely horrible experience. Friends and I stayed until close and I walked toward entrance, walked back because I realized I left my coat on the chair. Coat was already gone and they said \"someone in my party took it.\" Everyone in my party was with me. I\\'m 100% sure this bar stole my coat for no reason though I asked where it was multiple times. Feel free to go if you want to be swindled. I would rate this experience as a 2.5 out of 5.\\n\\nI ordered the Buddha Delight, to go, and it was ready rapidly.  This was both good and bad - how was it done so fast?  Would this mean a sacrifice in quality?\\n\\nWell, kind of.  I thought most of the veggies in the dish were good and cooked well, but the sauce was just a little too full of raw soy sauce flavor, and the rice seemed to be pre-packed in the container for awhile.  A small piece of beef also snuck its way into my meal, which wasn\\'t ideal.\\n\\nAnywho, it wasn\\'t the worst but wasn\\'t the best - maybe next time I\\'ll dine in and hope for some slow cooked flavor and attention to detail. The place is supposed to be a bar with superior beer.  22 beers on tap or whatever they claim.  The beers on tap are mostly summer/spring beers.  Plenty of pale ales, ambers, and white beers.  They have 1 IPA...ONE IPA!  Are you serious?  At least get Victory Hop Devil over Prima Pils to get more IPAs in there.  \\n\\nThe service is also terrible.  It\\'s always packed.  When it\\'s not packed and you get a seat, as soon as it gets packed they try and kick you out of your seat.  We were eating our food and the waitress tried to kick us out of our table.  Are they serious?  Can they at least let us finish our food before they kick us out of the table.  I understand the waitress wants to maximize her tips, but we need to finish eating 1st.  \\n\\nThe other thing is it is terribly over priced.  The beers are $3.30(Kenzinger) $4.40, $5.50, $6.60, $7.70 etc.  Can you please round to the nearest dollar?  Not only that, but the beer is over priced.  Something that should be $5 is $6.60 etc.  A tiny sandwich is also $8.  The food is so expensive.  The food isn\\'t THAT great to pay that much for it.\\n\\nThe bottom line is if you want to go to a good beer bar in West Philly, drive, ride your bike, or walk an extra 10 blocks or so to Dock Street.  Better food, and WAY better beer for a cheaper price. exactly what this 2 star rating system says it is... \"Meh. I\\'ve experienced better.\"\\nIf you\\'re in philly, just drive somewhere else or walk to a diff cheesesteak place in this market and get a better one. \\n\\nThe cheesesteak was meh. the meat was dry and kinda bland. \\n\\nSome good things though... they do give you a lot of meat. more than carmen\\'s which is also in the market. and the cheese was pretty good (i got provolone)\\n\\n\\nBut yeah. not the best chesesteak. \\n\\njust go to Dinic\\'s and get a roast pork with broccoli rabe I came here with my family expecting a fun twist on healthy fast food. I was very disappointed in the selection and my kids were not interested. I think the prices were too high to feed our family. We would rather go elsewhere, or an chain restaurant and make healthy choices than come here.  My husband didn\\'t mind the food, but he was just stopping here himself.  We didn\\'t like the idea of spending so much on our kids, when it just went to waste. Third visit in a row there was only 3 registers open!  Lines were 5+ deep and management doesn\\'t seem to rush to open more.  Ridiculous. Worst service I\\'ve had in recent memory-stopped in for quick bite before a movie-waited forever to have order taken-had to flag a busboy to get a waitress- once served food was typical sports bar fare nothing exceptional-had to go to hostess / station to get our check - waitress was MIA again!! Had breakfast in this place years ago & wasn\\'t impressed - won\\'t return & would not recommend Too pricey for what they have to offer. Lunch specials way overpriced. Very bland atmosphere, will not go there again Lack people skills.  Very rude. \\nIt\\'s convenient for me since I work at the hospital but will not go back.  \\nI\\'ll do my dunkin in Admore. Half decent food. The owner is not friendly at all. A good owner circulates amongst the dinning room to check on patrons, to give a salutation and how are things , and most importantly, ( Thanking a Patron) as they leave the establishment, not simply walking directly by you saying nothing.\\nThis business isn\\'t for him nor anyone who operates in such manner. Don\\'t take every $ dollar earned  for granted. Show some gratitude.  Any business on that stretch of 611 is hit or miss, as the case anywhere in this economy, and can fold up like a road map within weeks or months from now. Just look at the boarded up places on Old York Road.  It is starting to look like Atlantic City in spots, out of business. It\\'s not New Haven Pizza.  \\n\\nThe crust is not cooked (black) from a (stone) wood fired oven, therefore it lacks the taste. It is very thin, which is good. \\n\\nThe sauce is sweet, but fair.   I guess it\\'s a good pizza for the area. We used to love dinniñg here and would often pick up great pizza that was worth the extra price, but never again. We ordered a scillian Taormina\\'s pizza. First we were disappointed it was chopped tomatoes not sauce, ok that was our assumption. But we could not find the fresh mozzarella. Our guests asked if there was cheese or if it\\'s just a tomato pie. We said there was supposed to be fresh mozzarella on it. A few people thought they may have had a little on theirs but we basically payed $18 for pizza dough with chopped tomatoes and some basil and garlic. My husband called to talk to the manager when we were told he would be in. That was two days later and he insisted he knew for sure that there was cheese on it. He said he helped cut our pizza and he knows for sure there was cheese on it. He would not do anything to make us feel satisfied to come back. Our call was 2 days later, was our pizza the only one they made, that he can actually remember that he was certain we had cheese? Well we didn\\'t, maybe a few pieces at the most. What happened to customer service? We heard the original owners don\\'t own it anymore. That\\'s probably why it\\'s not the same. We very rarely complain or write negative reviews, but don\\'t insist on something that we were dissatisfied with. Growing up in Philadelphia, I know a good Pizza from a bad pizza . Last night we got a great pizza from another local place that was more reasonable that we never tried before. So thanks to our bad experience another place gets our business and we save $. Went for breakfast here because of the dog adoption event being held there. Arrived 15 minutes after they opened, started out with cocktails, which were very good. It was downhill from there. They were out of tater tots, which is part of one of there breakfast specials. After waiting a fairly long time for the food to come, two of the meals were cold. They were sent back, came back out a couple of minutes later lukewarm. Did not have these issues the first time, not sure what is going on now but won\\'t be back for breakfast. I HATE Good Dog because of the staff.\\n\\nI really wanted to like it because it seems so chill, and the food is ok, but they reallllllllly don\\'t know how to treat people.\\n\\nAmong several bad experiences (shady double chargings, a friend losing her wallet and management telling her to stop f***ing calling because they didn\\'t have it), I went one night to meet friends.\\n\\nAt this point, based on several bad experiences I mentioned, it was not my top choice, but that\\'s where the crew was.  \\n\\nAt 1:45 they called last call.  At 1:48, with full beers, they told us to GET THE F**K out, they were closing.  Now, (with a few drinks in me especially) that doesn\\'t sit well.  I turned to the bartender and said, \"c\\'mon man, don\\'t talk to us that way, we just ordered a beer, we had a long night, and we\\'re in the industry, we\\'ll be out in a few minutes.\" \\n\\nHe responded, \"If you\\'re in the industry, you should know when it\\'s time to (yelling now, in my face) GET THE F**K  out!\"  Ohhhh how I wish I hadn\\'t already tipped him, but of course he knew I had, and it made no difference.  \\n\\nMy friend, who is also a bartender, could see me getting heated.  He shook the guys hand, said we didn\\'t mean any trouble, and ushered me out.  \\n\\nThe bouncer chased us outside, and accused that same friend who diffused the situation of spitting his beer out on the door.  \\n\\nI wish I were exaggerating, but I\\'m not.  Also, I wasn\\'t drunk, I had only three beers.  It was beyond absurd.  \\n\\nThe next day, I called management, something I had never done, and haven\\'t since.  I explained the situation, and the woman I spoke to said, \"Ohhhhh honey\", (I don\\'t like to be called honey by stangers btw), \"you\\'ve just gotta understand...they had a long night, they deal with a lot of people, don\\'t take it personally\". \\n\\nI will NEVER go back.  The staff was beyond excusable, yet they were excused by management.  It\\'s the whole culture of the place.  I can get PBR elsewhere, thanks. I\\'m writing this review after four trips to the Boathouse.\\n\\nExpensive: fish and chips for $18? \\nSaving grace: free order of 10 wings with every pitcher of beer ($15)\\n\\nToo bad the wings really suck on free wing day. What happened guys?\\n\\nI will only come back here if my boyfriend drags me. It is okay for what it is, but the prices are not worth it at all. They have a great selection of beer, which is what draws in a large crowd. I booked the \"wine cellar\" for a party.  The \"wine cellar\" is actually a dark, dingy, dirty basement without any wine. It\\'s gross.  We ended up staying upstairs because it was brighter and the door was open so the fresh air was nice and there weren\\'t any other people up there.  We did the premium Boozer tasting and the wines were not good.  One was a New Jersey wine (no offense, Jersey but I wouldn\\'t call that premium) and the other was so bad we all had to dump it out.  This was a terrible first stop for our weekend away and, sadly, they still charged me $100 for the gross basement we didn\\'t use. Would not recommend. I\\'m not sure what has happened but OG has really gone down hill. The food is very bland, shrimp are the same you can purchase from Walmart, salad is swimming in salad dressing and very salty, and the bread sticks are rock hard and rolled in salt. There is nothing good about OG anymore. The food quality is in the toilet. We won\\'t be patronizing any of their establishments ever again. I\\'ll only give a one star review if something has gone wrong and nothing is done to fix it. \\n\\nDecided to visit here as I\\'m an avid craft beer person. Most of the list was comprised of IPA\\'s...which is fine...but just something I\\'m trying to steer clear of. So first  I asked for a Belgium style beer...can\\'t at all remember the name of it. Thought it was OK...nothing too great. So once I finished that one...decided to try something more local...I went with the Tired Hands Shambolic Saisson. \\n\\nI\\'ve had my fair share of Saisson\\'s...and I know they\\'re usually fruitier. This one was limy...in other words SOUR. I didn\\'t love my first beer...and I didn\\'t at all care for my second one. Just not my taste. I almost thought I was drinking a cider ale. Bleh.\\n\\nI asked the bartender to try something else.. He said ok...and I tried something else...which I loved. So i ordered that...and drank it. \\n\\nFinally I asked for the check...and to my surprise the beer I returned is still on there. I asked what the deal with and the bartender says. \"Sorry I already poured it..it\\'s our policy.\" I\\'ve worked at many a restaurants and I have never in my life told a guest who didn\\'t like something that they had to pay for it. ESPECIALLY for BEER ON TAP. That\\'s the easiest solution ever. The actual cost of the beer poured is maybe $2 if that. \\n\\nI\\'ll be honest...I write this to hopefully get managements attention...because I feel this isn\\'t their policy. And if it is their policy not to refund things people don\\'t like...then I\\'ll gladly leave it. I\\'ve never given a restaurant 1 star but this experience was terrible. I\\'ve been there many times and had never had an experience like this there. The waitress was miserable, looked me in the eyes and didn\\'t answer when I asked her a question. The chips were stale and we were only give a tiny amount of salsa. Our margaritas tasted like pure syrup and all three of our meals were soggy and room temperature. Sign says open 9am-7pm. Arrived at 3pm.... it was closed. Needless to say we were disappointed. Unfortunately I can only give 3 stars. I\\'ve been coming to Parc for brunch to celebrate my birthday for the last 7 years and this is the first time I\\'ve been disappointed. I want to say that, because I truly think it was a one off experience but regardless the way my situation was handled was unprofessional and needs to be shared.\\nMy omelette came, for lack of better terms, runny. An omelette, should be cooked, and when you press the top with your fork the yolk should not come drizzling out. But this is how I was served a $14 omelette. Totally inedible. We considered not sending it back but i tried to take two bites and felt ill. The server quickly took it away and apologized. We waited about 15 minutes for a replacement to be sent. It was a busy morning so I completely understand the wait. Mistakes happen, and it was honestly not a big deal. The replacement omelette was delicious and cooked to perfection. My issue was when the manager came over to ask how it turned out. I replied this is great, exactly how I expected it. Instead of ending the conversation as she should have, she told me I needed to specify I wanted the omelette well done next time to avoid this. Never in my life have I had to order an omelette with the cooking expectations. This is unheard of. The kitchen made a mistake, own it. Do not blame the customer. Most importantly do not blame the returning customer. For any restaurant I\\'d be shocked to be spoken to this way but for a Starr restaurant where I\\'m paying $150 for brunch it\\'s completely inappropriate. Held a corporate work event with extremely disappointing results. Guests were showing up and leaving because there were no drinks, food was sparse and out hours after it should have been. When they did bring food out, it was an appetizer at a time for dozens of people, it was swarmed so quickly that it was gone before anybody could even blink. My team turned into cocktail waiters to make up for their lack in staffing. Could not believe it! It would be a 5 but yall gonna play me and give me old fried chicken and then try and smother it with stew gravy.  That\\'s NOT stew chicken don\\'t do that we can tell !!!!!  Shame on you !!! Chicken be all hard. That stew gravy don\\'t soften it up. We stopped in for a couple of drinks.  The bartenders were pleasant enough, but their knowledge about what they were serving varied greatly depending on which was serving you.  The service was also surprisingly slow.  Bartenders were making each drink individually, rather than making several order of the same drink at the same time.  This might be excusable for expertly made drinks, but these were not.\\n\\nThe alcohol itself was disappointing as well.  The gin was very harsh, very piney.  The brown whiskey had a overly smokey scotch flavor that is not something that I go for, but others might like.  The vodka and rums were both fine.  I wanted to try the white whiskey in their manhattan, but I was told that they ran out... which was weird.  Apparently they make the manhattans in a batch and then pour them out of a container. Went here to have my first go at a Philly Cheesteak. Disappointing is how I\\'d describe my experience here. \\n\\nThe sandwich was dripping with fat and oil. The steak was not seasoned properly. It tasted very bland. And I could feel my arteries getting clogged with every single bite. Maybe it\\'s not the restaurant. Maybe all cheesteaks are this way. Not getting one anytime again soon. This review is a little late. Food was okay, nothing great. I liked the grilled octopus, didn\\'t enjoy much else. The mediterranean plate was pretty normal. The place was packed. Service was poor because of the seating. We were a party of four, but one of our friends was a bit late (there was a huge storm outside and he arrived drenched), so we asked if we could get a table first and place our orders (along with his) since he would be arriving.  We were ravenous after being in queue for so long. They wouldn\\'t let us, and we had to stay in queue until he arrived. A table of 3 and 4 - not much difference. They don\\'t have tables of 3 so we would be on a 4-seater anyway. We queued the standard time, so I think we should be allowed to sit considering we also told them we were ordering straight away, including our friend\\'s share, so we weren\\'t holding anything up. Inflexible policy. I\\'d be more likely to understand if they had 3 people tables as well or we were ordering later. I really didn\\'t see the problem with letting us sit first at the 4 man table. Server was friendly though, and chatted with us a bit, but the experience was already ruined. I\\'d say the food is 3*, but I\\'m docking one for the initial service. OK, so the reason this place gets a low rating is simple... VALUE!  I went in and ordered only a burger. Let me say that again... ONLY A BURGER. No fries, no drink. Just a burger with 2 paid toppings, 2 complimentary toppings. Bacon and cheese were upcharge items, ketchup and grilled onions were free. Total cost for this... $9.50. For $9.50, this was the most unimpressive burger I\\'ve eaten for a nearly $10 price tag. At 5 Guys, I\\'d get fries and a drink with that for right around the same price...and honestly, the burgers at 5 Guys are a substantially better product. The burger was not a bad burger...just ENTIRELY too expensive for such a weak delivery. The next time I spend that kind of dough on a burger, it\\'ll be at a place that uses local beef or at the new Red Robin. Also, for the same money, do yourself a favor and drive the extra 5 minutes and go to Grub Burger. Just ordered delivery for the third time here. All my previous experiences were good expect for this one. The person taking my order seemed irritated and rushed me off the phone. Before I can finish placing my order he asked my how I will be paying. I asked if I could use a certain payment (school cash) and he said he could not process that over the phone. Then when I told him I\\'ve done that in every other occasion he figured out how to do it. After he told me the total I told him I also wanted a ginger ale and that I wasn\\'t done ordering then he says we don\\'t have that, then proceeded to read off all the sodas they had then realized he indeed had ginger ale (Canada Dry). Decent food terrible service. First of all, it\\'s freezing inside. Secondly, I had one of the employees ask for me to hand him the microphone in the middle of my song. Then ended my song and handed it to another girl so she could sing her song. They\\'ll say that they\\'re booked on songs but then give the microphone to their friends that come in. That or the employees will sing songs together. It was my birthday and I wasn\\'t even able to sing a full song. Never again. We ordered takeout a few times, trying different dishes. So far, the sushi and sea food and dishes close to Cantonese style are worth trying, sorta fresh with light but right flavor. \\n\\nProblem with this restaurant is they are trying to include too big a range of dishes from different regions of China, most of which the cook is really not good at. Northern style foods are too salty and have way too much soy sauce; Sichuan food got no right spice and taste; fried dishes have too thick mushy coating on plus thick, heavy, sticky sauce; dumplings with wrappers thicker than cardboard... \\n\\nBTW, if you are not in a hurry, don\\'t try the lunch buffet. The limited choice, less than a dozen, charge more than a Chinese buffet with full menu and tons of choices. And the dishes are put out and left there too long, not tasting good. The food is OK, the beer is decent, but the service is pretty lousy. It shouldn\\'t take forever to take our orders in a 3/4 empty place! We won\\'t be back, sorry, Iron Hill and Craft Ale House are superior in every way. Ordered through Uber Eats. Sent one less garlic naan which is about 4 dollars and 20 cents. Called to complain and the first guy told me whatever I ordered is what I got after five minutes of me trying to explain the situation. When I got agitated - told me to not shout at him. Then the owner intervened and told me I can get a refund \"next time\" I order without taking my name out number down. I got a refund though Uber eats. Now about the food - it\\'s not that great. Don\\'t eat here. Food was actually not bad.  Hash browns were not crispy though. That\\'s a must should have to ask. But pancakes were tasty  My coffee cup came out w food on it and place is in desperate need of update.  I pulled up online coupon which cashier told me I could but them said it was to small to read. Never mind the fact they had a pile then could have used to get code off she called up mgr and he said no he wouldn\\'t take it seriously!!! Bad management. One of the most overrated and disappointing restaurants in the area in my opinion, and I hate to say that because all I heard prior to visiting here were positive things about it from friends and colleagues. In fact, all the glowing compliments people said are what brought it to my attention and compelled me to eventually visit. But if Anthony\\'s doesn\\'t change its approach to new customers, I think that its reputation is going to suffer. My wife and I visited this place and were immediately shocked by how standoffish the waitstaff was to us. It was so hard to believe that the place we were visiting was the same place so many people had raved about. Unfortunately, this topic was the bulk of our dinner conversation. The only explanation that we could muster for the bizarre behavior was that this place has a firm set of older customers that frequent the place, and Anthony\\'s isn\\'t too interested in extending business beyond this core of clientele. The food was above average, nothing spectacular, but all of it was overshadowed by the unfriendly ethos. If that were to change, this place could easily be a 3 or 4. Almost every time I come they are closed (during hours they SHOULD be open) the one time they were open, the soft serve ice cream machine was down and so was their credit card machine. \\n\\nI ordered a brownie sundae instead and the brownie was rock hard and stale ($10 too) I told the employee and they just stared at me. I asked for a waffle sandwich instead. She looked at me like she had no idea what I was referring too, when the place is KNOWN for this, so I pointed to it on the menu. She said \"oh no we don\\'t have that, we have waffle cones\". I\\'m assuming she was new, completely clueless, or they were just out of waffle mix like they were out of soft serve. So I asked for a small gelato instead and for her to refund the difference. She asked me for the receipt and I told her I had just thrown it out, she then proceeded to tell me to grab it out of the trash (keep in mind she just rang me up minutes prior) I walked over to start looking in the trash to get my $7 back and another customer stood up for me and demanded she give my money back. Needless to say she was pissed, didn\\'t say a word and as soon as she gave me my money she stormed to the back. \\n\\nI\\'m not sure what\\'s going on with the staff there this summer, why they are out of things all of the time or closed when they should be open, but this type of service is unacceptable. I will not be returning as long as they have rude kids running the business! I recommend going elsewhere for ice cream! The food was ok, but not worth the price. I understand that you\\'re paying for the atmosphere  here. But you can pay the same price, for the same atmosphere, and get better food next door at parc.\\n\\nThe drinks were watered down and overpriced as well. So they let another guy in with sneakers and don\\'t let my date in.   Bullshit.  Skip! The worst treatment and meal I have ever tasted. I was looking forward to dining on their specialty ribs recommended by a very good friend just to have a good start to my new year only to be disappointed by a last minute change in menu. I fasted all day waiting for my rib craving to be satisfied and in its place was an appetizer of  overcooked tasteless fried shrimp and a pickled salad that made me want to regurgitate it. My entree was something resembling a baked tomato and a steak that was actually cooked somewhat well and horseradish mashed potatoes without the horseradish.\\nThat was the meal now for the treatment and atmosphere they sat us the only african american couple next to not only the coffee pot and storage area but we were fortunate enough to be blessed with being near the bathroom and a closet as well with all that you would think the waitress sporting dreads would be understanding ... Sadly no she was without any personality or compassion. I will never dine at Tavern on the Hill ever !!! not because of the night but because they knew how we were treated and did nothing to improve our experience. STAY AWAY !!! Just OK for now. Used to be 5+!  PLEASE GET MORE HELP! One bartender serving the bar and service is not enough! Used to be our go to place but the last 3 visits killed the original vibe of this place.  Bartender is so busy that sitting at bar is so not relaxing anymore -  watching him rush around, slam coolers, all because he is taking care of a full bar and service! Get more help.  Bring back the vibe. The Big Beers are where it\\'s at.  And if you\\'re really trying to get it in, order a Big Long Island Iced Tea.  23ounces of forgetting the rest of your night.\\n   Oh yeah, and if you order a Cheese Steak after like 4:30 or something, they actually give you a sandwich and a half. Three strikes, you\\'re out. I have never had a good visit at this location and I have tried several times. Last night, I went with the family and ordered the apple chicken salad. The chicken was not moist or juicy and 3/4 of the salad was the yellow part of the lettuce. Go to Panera Bread for a better salad with a better price.The garlic bread was fine and the service was fine. \\nMy first visit several years ago was a disappointment. I ordered the fish sandwich and it came with two pieces of fish; one was fine, the other was like rubber and not edible. Maybe it had been warmed up or was cooked twice. I will not be returning to the restaurant. Smelly. Great little neighborhood bar, super duper bartender. But it can be smelly. This place used to be cool, but then they started making all these stupid decisions. No sitting at tables if you aren\\'t ordering food. No using the folding chairs if someone else shows up to your table. Playing the stupid cable music channels instead of someones ipod. \\n\\nGood dog has the pool table and the arcade machines, but it\\'s just not worth it. The fries are good at first, but you get over them. The food is not good at all. I was hoping for something that tasted even a little bit homemade and delicious. The meatballs were the worst I\\'ve ever had and tasted like something from a freezer bag with gross red sauce. The salad was a tragedy! The eggplant was barely there! For the price, and the appearance, I thought it\\'d be a great new fast food place but I was sadly mistaken. The waitre asked us to separate the table in a rude way and if there is a less than one star i will give them that. Why is the ice cream machine never working??? Why is the staff so rude at all hours??? These are the questions that keep me awake at night I was excited to go to this bar because of its great location and seemingly cool exterior.  Upon entering to meet with some friends in the dining area at 10:30pm we were told quite rudely by bald bartender guy that we were not allowed to add a third table because he said quote I can\\'t have 3 tables all together in the middle of my dining room end quote.  Funny thing is, it was 10:30 at night, as previously mentioned in this review, and there were only two other tables of people in the whole place, which left shortly after our arrival.  Apparently keeping your \"dining area\" completely clear for potential diners is more important than a group of 6 people who would like to have purchased many an alcoholic beverage at this establishment.\\n\\nAfter the rest of the dining room had cleared we inched our table over to be closer to our friends and baldo\\'s minion came over, and blasted between the tables shoving us out of the way and putting the table back in it\\'s designated spot, saying jerkily, \"sorry guys have to keep this clear for the fire marshall\".  Wow, customer service.\\n\\nWhen we couldn\\'t put up with anymore of this \"I own a bar so do what I say attitude\" we decided to leave, at which point baldy had his last say as we walked out, yelling at us an extremely sarcastic \"thanks for coming guys\".  \\n\\nLast time I checked my money is just as green as anyone else\\'s.  I will not return to this place and recommend that you don\\'t either.  If you are looking for a place to chill and have a drink with friends, try your luck elsewhere.  Hopefully these guys get their act together because they have a great location and potential to be a pretty decent spot, but with \"customer service\" (note the quotes) like this, they won\\'t be growing as a bar anytime soon. The food has been good for my lunch experiences. Usually pretty tasty although you can tell the quality of the ingredients are not high grade. But for a 9.00 portion you get a lot. Unfortunately, the last few times I was in there, there has been a rather rude young man, perhaps the owners nephew..? Anyway, this young person was very rude and the quality of the food has fell off over the last few times that I will not return. I will pay a couple extra dollars and be served with a smile and higher grade ingredients down the road in the borough. One thing restaurants often forget right before they go out of business is that their counter staff determines the image that the customers walk away with. This young man at the counter was not representing their restaurant in its best interest. Up to this point there has been a man about 40 or so who was very polite and the food was also better. I feel they will not be around much longer. Why the manager on duty decided to have a new waitress wait on my party on a busy Friday night is beyond me. She screwed up our food orders multiple times, took a while to come back with our food, then messed up with the bill. I\\'m not blaming the waitress- it\\'s not her fault. I blame management for not having anyone assist her with our large party on a busy night. I was expecting the sushi to be great, but I\\'ve had better from local grocery stores. \\nThe bar staff wasn\\'t friendly, and the drink I ordered didn\\'t taste great either. \\nThe only reason why I\\'m giving two stars is because I liked my entree (chicken and broccoli) and the party room I rented was a nice atmosphere. \\nI would not visit this place again or recommend it. There are much better places to spend an evening out in Philly. Went here with a group of friends some time back.  We all thought it was pretty meh, at most.  I had an earl grey and scotch cocktail (cannot remember the name) which was alright.  No one was terribly impressed by the food, and I had the worst mussels in my entire life.  I did not eat more than a couple of bites.  This place is getting two stars, because the staff seemed friendly and nice. Never eat the filet of fish during off peak hours. Unless you like sitting in the bathroom while you write a review No pun intended but service is slow as molasses. I was done me my food before the hashbrowns came out.  NEVER AGAIN. I placed an order online at 12:48. It\\'s now 1:38 and I\\'m still waiting. Place is a zoo, very poor management, can\\'t keep up with orders and people canceling their orders after waiting 45 min already. This is totally incompetence, total insanity. I frequent Panera\\'s all across the country and have NEVER IN MY LIFE had an experience like this. \\n\\nWe will see if the order is correct after waiting over an hour. Somehow I doubt it. Will update Have been to Zoe\\'s more than a handful of times and have always enjoyed what I got. The past couple of times I ordered a salad and it was not very appealing at all. The first thing I saw was brown lettuce all throughout, probably the majority of the salad was brown and tons of slimy pieces as well. When I order a salad I expect it to be fresh and appealing and not have to throw half of it out. How hard is it to make a salad with fresh produce? Unfortunately I will not be back to this Zoe\\'s again. Went on a busy Friday night. Service was NOT good other than our bus girl - EMILY who totally rocked. We were wishing She was our server. \\nTold her we\\'d come back when she got promoted. We mean it!\\nAnd who do restaurants think they are adding 20% gratuity  (5 adults & 1 kid) and NOT even telling us? Guess they were hoping for the \"double tip\" which we ALL have unknowingly done........  \\nFood was very average IF THAT.  I never met a brick oven pizza I didn\\'t like - til that night - isn\\'t it suppose to be crispy? Husband said his steak was good - YAY b/c nothing else was.  Grilled Calamari should be firm in texture not soggy which mine was. I regret not sending it back - what was I thinking?\\nThe good part is the place is BYOB. maybe if you drink enough you won\\'t notice the food/service............. No wait, staff was helpful. I had a lemonade, regular pretzel, and a cheese dip. The lemonade tasted like detergent. I have no idea what it was, but it wasn\\'t anywhere close to lemon. The pretzel was more akin to a street vendor\\'s than Aunt Anne\\'s. (Wasn\\'t good) The cheese dip was the only tasty thing I got, which is sad. We went to Sabrina with high expectations reading all the reviews, but were quite disappointed with the food we had for brunch. We are vegetarians and had the veg frittatas and French toast that was just okay. We also had pancakes that were very dry, and the veggie philly cheesestake (which we asked the waiter how it was and he recommended it) that was oily and devoid of any taste except the smell of pungent cheese. Coffee was average and the hot chocolate just way too sugary we couldn\\'t drink it. The portions were large and we didn\\'t want to waste food which is why we parceled it just to give it away to the homeless in town. I hope Sabrina ups their game in the future. Excited to try this out for months, but not thrilled with my meal. I\\'m not an expert in Indian food, but having eaten a whole lot of it, I can say with confidence that I have had much worse and much better than what Tiffin offers.\\n\\nThey delivered out to GradHo, which was great. The delivery came just when they said it would. Best item of the haul, by far, was baigan bharta. I have high standards for this dish and Tiffin exceeded them. It\\'s light, spicy, and amazing. The lamb saag was terrific, but loses points for being so light on lamb. For $12, I want to see more than three tiny scraps of meat. The biggest disappointment was butter chicken: bland and consisting mostly of gravy. For the money, there was hardly any chicken to be found.  I was similarly let down by the breads. The tandoori roti was chewy, as though it had been microwaved. A paratha was better, but not by much.\\n\\nI\\'d order again, but would stick to the vegetarian offerings. Great pho and spring rolls, always get #19\\nPeople there are so nice and friendly. But Last time I went, they started to sweep the floor right when I was eating, yayy! Great now my food is filled with dust. I was dissppointed but got even more grossed out when one of the person who works there spit up his mucus right inthe sink where they gave out the water! Yuck, I don\\'t think I\\'ll be going back. Me and my husband went to olive garden on a Sunday night just to go out since we haven\\'t been in awhile. Walk through the door, instantly judged, got sat, waitress never greeted us. Skipped our table several times, basically threw plates in our faces. Ordered a alcoholic beverage that had to wait nearly a half hour for because it just \\'slipped her mind\\', my husbands soup was two spoonfuls, breadsticks were extremely greasy and not salted. Got two refills of breadsticks to come to find they were giving us like 2 each time. My husband got the tour of italy, chicken was dry, very very small portions. My chicken parm was greasy and got barely a handful of linguini. We wanted dessert, but by the attitude from our server (who I can\\'t even say considering they didn\\'t even greet us), being ignored, watched by managers, waiting an absurd amount of time for one beverage, not even checking back with us to make sure everything was good, and questioning the gift card we had to make sure it \\'worked\\', it was overall a terrible experience. I\\'ve loved going there with family and friends but it\\'s a shame how one horrible time can stop a person from returning. I am a server myself and I understand how things can get, but witnessing everything and it wasn\\'t busy, and to wait for a beverage for that long? If I ever did that I wouldn\\'t get a good tip, possibly no tip. Still trying to figure out why I tipped so good. Hope everyone over there can get over themselves and actually do their job and do it correctly. Just to clarify, it\\'s been a year since I ate here for my anniversary dinner, but my memory of the place still stings. I remember the foie gras was pretty damn good. The experience of having chartreuse with my meal was amazing as well. The escargot was my first experience and I told the waiter it tasted like...well....dirt. He could not argue, of course, because even if you say it tastes \"earthy\" and of \"minerals\" it basically means the same thing. Unfortunately, I was unpleasantly surprised when my entree came because my fish was REALLY salty. When I told the waiter he took my plate and came back to tell me the chef tasted it and he didn\\'t think it was salty at all. The waiter then told me the chef wanted me to pay the check and leave. I was mortified and totally freaked out. The waiter laughed and said it was just a joke.\\n\\nThis was SO not funny. It was actually my first experience with \"fancy French cuisine\" and here, on my special trying-French-for-the-first-time anniversary dinner, I was so freaked out I went to the bathroom and sobbed for 5 minutes under the influence of a horrible sense of humor and chartreuse before I could calm myself down and finish my dining experience. Needless to say, I will not ever be back. What a shame, most of the food was pretty wonderful. I have eaten here a handful of times and the food and service were usually good. But definitely not tonight. The food and service was TERRIBLE.  We waited a good 20 minutes after we were seated before our waitress showed up at our table to ask if me wanted any drinks. And then, our salad and bread sticks took about another 15 minutes before they made an appearance.  Our order was finally taken about another 20 minutes after that. We sat and waited for our food that took entirely too long to come out.  Finally, our waitress brought out our order but then disappeared again to only God knows where.  My boyfriend was just about finished his meal when I had to yell across the room to ask the waitress if she was still going to bring us our condiments.  If a restaurant is busy, that is understandable but it was not; there were only 3 or 4 other tables.  As a customer that is spending $80 on a meal, I would expect better food and service.  Needless to say, I  am going to stick with Erin\\'s Pub in Norwood, and I advise you all to do the same. This is the third hibachi place I have tried since moving to PA and they are all so mediocre! My daughter and I came during the week and it was dead. We were the only 2 at the hibachi table. The cook was very nice and would make jokes with my daughter. The food was average...not bad but not great either. The server was very quiet and a little creepy. I\\'m just glad I used a BOGO coupon from the Entertainment book. That was an odd coupon too. It was BOGO for the hibachi dinners only but the max value was $12. All of the dinners were $18 or more. So, not really free, huh? I wouldn\\'t go back. I tried it and could have loved it. But I didn\\'t. This place is always disappointment. Very bad customer service, be prepared to wait forever for your meal. Today I waited 15 minutes before the waitress even got to my table to take the order. Seriously disappointed, especially after being a huge fan of Amada. Had a 9:15 reservation, but were told the table was not ready, and would be in 15 minutes-ok fine. We weren\\'t seated until 10. On top of being inappropriate to not have the table ready for nearly an hour, being a very visible 9 months pregnant, standing in a foyer for 45 minutes was extremely uncomfortable. Once seated, service was extremely slow. It took asking 4 separate times & getting to our third course just to get bread. The wait time in between courses was ridiculous- at least 40 minutes between some. We didn\\'t get out of there until after 1 AM, which I find totally unacceptable for a 9:15 reservation. I understand it was NYE, so things were more  hectic than normal, but they were beyond ill-equipped and too poorly managed to handle the evening. I definitelyexpect more out of a Garces restaurant. The only save was that the food was great... However, after being tired and annoyed, we couldn\\'t even enjoy it that much. Service was great, but food-wise I thought it was weirdly overpriced, especially when you consider that vegetarian cuisine is much cheaper to produce than meat! The server told us we should get 3 dishes per person... Thank goodness we didn\\'t, they were big! I wouldn\\'t really describe them as tapas-sized. One of my friend\\'s dishes was downright inedible (parsnip soup) but there were one or two goodies. (A mushroom cutlet) Everything else was mediocre and I was surprised - I had expected better in a place like this. I wouldn\\'t go out of my way to go back. One of the young ladies behind the counter has a nasty attitude.  Note to owner: higher someone more qualified.  You will gain more business instead of lose. i used to love papa john\\'s but i order food yesterday and the chicken was  half cooked and the delivery driver wanted my money but act like he did want to touch my hand to get it and with the things that are going on with papa jhon\\'s i would have thought service would have been better so i would not  be coming back because i don\\'t like the way i was treated he really did not want to bring me my food and because i am a different race that was not cool I ordered Fat Jacks from DoorDash delivery at 3:00 PM. Got a call from my driver an hour and a half later saying they cancelled my order because they \"ran out\" just like they always do. First of all, how does a bbq place constantly run out of chicken and collard greens...that amazes me? Second of all...the order was never cancelled on my end..so it couldn\\'t have been DoorDash. They claim they cancelled it on their end. This is the third time I\\'ve had issues with this place and their constant running out of food. They also screw up the delivery every time. Do not order form Fat Jacks BBQ....horrible all the time. Barley tried to make it right or do anything for my inconvenience. I used to LOVE Kanella. I was so excited to bring my boyfriend here from Baltimore. And wow was I embarrassed. The service was cold. The food was cold. We were rushed. Appetizers came after drinks - well after. An ordered second cocktail was entirely forgotten. \\n\\nIt was really sad. Kanella is a place I have recommended, and loved, for years. Pei Wei\\'s food is not good. Pad Thai didn\\'t taste like Pad Thai and their version of General Tso\\'s Chicken was not good, either. You\\'re better off going to a real chinese restaurant. We have been eating here since 1992 and always loved what was served to us. Yesterday was the first time we were unhappy. The pan fried dumplings were dark brown. Very brown. I consider that burnt. We contemplated returning them to the kitchen when we heard sustained shouting and shushing coming from behind the door.  Hmmm. Kitchen trouble.  Then the moo shu came and it was not very flavorful but had a big glop of glass noodles that were unblended into the mixture. And they were overdone and gelatinous. Very disappointed. Are things going downhill here? Sub par. Overpriced food, indifferent service, outstanding decor. \\nIf I had walked in with a machete, I would have murdered many of the staff and demanded a properly cooked hamburger and more attentive servers... but despite their aesthetic, they\\'re not the post-apocalypse: they\\'re just a crappy burger joint with a couple of menu items of extremely high-end steak choices to try to impress you. (ooooooh you have imported steaks. I\\'m sure at a zillion dollars an ounce they\\'re not freezer burnt.)\\nUgh. I wish their kitchen lived up to their decor. Very disappointed with the service this morning. Our waitress was friendly but only saw her face once. She took our order and that was it. Never came back to ask how we were doing and waited 10 minutes after finishing our breakfast to drop off the check. A second cup of coffee was out of the question, clearly. Food was decent just really unhappy with the lack of service. Won\\'t be in a rush to go back. The cheesesteaks and pork sandwichs are delicious but there is no cleanliness at all!!! I ordered a pork sandwich ns the guy was cleaning the stove, with out gloves or even washing his hands, he grabbed the roll, cut it , scooped the roll out. He then made the sandwich and with his dirty hands put onions and pepper on the sandwich.(while coughing on the sandwich) They do not serve Philly cheesesteaks here. They serve steak sandwiches and that is NOT what I came all the way from NYC to eat. There was no cheese on this \"classic\" cheesesteak there was some cheez whiz spread on the bread in a tiny amount by a royally nasty piece of garbage at the cashier giving out \"playing cards\" in order to remember your order. What?   yes they did and when I asked him a question about it, his vacant blue eyes said something sarcastic and embarassed me in front of my kids. The cheap Philly cheesesteaks located on the trucks in the streets are better than this steak sandwich \"cheesesteak\"  I was expecting real cheese mixed in with the meat and I hated the mushrooms and the vegetables in the meat I do not care for that or the way this tasted.  I really did not like the lake of gravy/fat? this sandwich dripped all over the place. It was gross.  the man with Italy tattooed on his neck was a consummate professional. The cheesesteak tasted like a regular sandwich to me; nothing special. I could barely taste the cheese or even tell that it was there in the first place. the rude cashier took what looked like a steel stick and dipped it into melted cheese that looked like nachos cheese you know that chemical tasting melted stuff from 7-11? the same thing.  The steak was warm which was nice, but the flavor was lacking. The bread was also average, if not a bit dry.We happened to come on May 12 2018 when this nasty cashier was at the front. He was fat, obnoxious, pasty white and had blue eyes mean and nasty. I really was about to leave had it not been for Carmine\\'s reputation. He is the worst cashier and he is definately not Italian. The receipt said the cashier\\'s name was JIM so beware. For a neighborhood bar with a dive like atmosphere (forget the food, it is mediocre at best) they commit a cardinal sin: the smallest drink pours I have ever experienced ANYWHERE!   They redefine the definition of a \"1 finger\" drink.   If you are a beer drinker I guess you won\\'t care, but if you are out to drink booze, go elsewhere.  They do occasionally get some good live music, but tank up before you go. One more complaint: TVs all over the place, but no Hi- Def. This is my most favorite Target around.  They are usually very clean and well stocked.  It may be 2 floors, but it is worth a ride on the escalator to get all of your needs and none needs that Target convinces you to buy.\\n\\nDon\\'t buy their cafe food though.  I happened to be in the midst of a busy day and got a pretzel.  It was awful...just awful. if you\\'re ever thinking of getting chinese food i would definitely steer clear from this restaurant. i am an avid fan of chinese food and wanted to try a different place from my usual spots, worse decision i\\'ve ever made about food. the moment i came in i was greeted with a rude look and a waiter pointing to an empty table that had not been cleaned. when requesting to have a quick wipe down i was ignored. besides the service when the food arrived the chicken tasted bland and rubbery. avoid this place and walk two blocks down to Mandarin Palace on 19th street. I\\'ve been here before and the food and the service are good. This time I was blown away. I had an order to go and the order was messed up. I was shocked they fixed the order and refunded the money to me! I was okay with just getting the order corrected. You don\\'t see service like that at most places. Nothing fabulous. For a Saturday afternoon, it was really not busy. We\\'re not sure if that is because they\\'ve recently opened or because of the service. Service was not great. \\nV   e   r   y    S   l   o   w.\\nIt took far to long to bring our cold salad orders from the kitchen.\\nNot a place I would try again. Very hum drum. What\\'s with the attitude?\\n\\nThe two times the wife and I have come here, had to wait a while to order, and didn\\'t really get a very friendly vibe.\\n\\nFood is nothing to be excited about. There are several other much better breakfast/brunch options, so what\\'s with the attitude? Check out White dog or Sabrinas instead, for much better food and way friendlier service. The delivery was 10 minutes late and cold. She knocked on the door and asked for a cash tip when I already pre paid and put a tip that was more than 20%. Rude and cold. The bagel was also disgusting. Avoid ordering from here at all costs! So disappointed of that place ! Basically it\\'s a beautiful place but food is very average and the service was really bad. I had one of the worst waiter ever. And even after giving him 18% of tip he left and complained to the other server about the comment that with didn\\'t really like they\\'re pizza ! I do not recommend this place I\\'m from the midwest and this place could not make it in Memphis, KC or St. Louis.  Ribs were tough, portion size small for the price.  Service was only ok.  Will not be going here again. It\\'s bad enough that the beer didn\\'t live up to the hype.\\nIt\\'s bad enough that the food wasn\\'t up to par compared to the other restaurants on the hill.\\nThe service was bad too. We didn\\'t stay long enough, and didn\\'t bother remembering his name. \\nI\\'d say mid to late 20s with a beard and goatee. Very pompous, and full of himself. Ruined what was already a bad experience. \\nTons of restaurants on the Hill, never making the mistake of coming back here again! The free wifi here is BEYOND slow (there are maybe 3 other customers here this morning). Which is kind of ridiculous, considering this location is new and is set up like an internet cafe with work stations. I won\\'t be coming back here to try to get work done. I can\\'t even hook up to a hot spot here because for some reason the Verizon network doesn\\'t reach here successfully. But lookit this pastry....\\n\\nTo be fair, I\\'ve been here for lunch a few times and their food is decent. One time the salad was defrosted or something, but other stuff was ok. This is pretense and poor cooking with and unreasonable passion for salt, salt and salt. Service nice and friendly (Annette?). That\\'s the end of all praise. 2 avocado guac, $16.75, WTF? Clumsy cuisine that in no way supports the uppity prices. Go Qdoba and save money, humility AND gastric distress! The worst combo, getting ripped off for bub grub! I\\'ve had the food before, but ordered delivery which took over an hour and a half and the food was cold...looked like it was made when I ordered it. Won\\'t be ordering delivery again. Out of nowhere they changed the credit card minimum from $10 to $20. The waitress is still a bitch.\\n\\nAlso, CHANGE THE MUSIC.\\nGuess I won\\'t be back then. This place survives on location alone.  So many issues:\\n\\n1. The food is blah at best.  I had a decent lamb sandwich once, but of the two times I ordered the burger, I got sick afterwards each time.  Definitely undercooked.\\n2. Slow and inept service.  The employees have zero sense of urgency.\\n3. Requiring a keycard to use the restroom?  Laughable.\\n\\nThe only saving grace is that it could be a good bar environment to grab a pint after work, but the restroom issue kills that. Never went back.  We had a family party at this place and met several times with the owner to confirm the  menu and bar, and beverages.  The staff was unorganized and  nothing was ready as promise.  The wine was chosen by the owner, the champagne was not what I wanted and refills of drinks were served and billed when not ordered.  Soda was  suposed to be included and I was charged including refills .  End result, i got screwed.  Upon bringing it to the owners attention, he offered nothing to fix the situation.\\nAs an italian I don\\'t consider the food great and it is very overpriced.  I have never gone back and am booking my next party elsewhere where the food is good and I have dined and done my reseach.\\nAbout all you will get out of this restuarant is a nice building. I don\\'t usually write yelp reviews, and the unfortunate reality is most people don\\'t unless the food is really good or really bad....I\\'m the latter. \\n\\nDisclaimer, this review is only about my takeout order (UberEATS). \\n\\nThis sushi is BY FAR the worst I\\'ve had in a long time. I would put one star, but I added an extra star for the presentation. The sushi Lacked taste, texture, and anything that you\\'d expect from food served at any sort of establishment serving any quality of food. Not to mention the cost. I don\\'t mind paying a premium for what I order, but if I do pay a premium I expect the food to at least be a step above edible. I can\\'t remember the exact rolls we ordered, but they were ALL terrible. We also had the lamb sliders (admittedly something odd to get from a Sushi spot) and they were ok. But the fact that they served them on store bought potato bread rolls, another turn off. \\n\\nAll in all, I wouldn\\'t even give this place the benefit of the doubt and try them on another day. Not worth a dime IMO. Came all the way here for Creme Brulee. The custard tasted like a boxed dessert made weeks in advance. Couldn\\'t get past the first spoon. Not really sure why we stopped here but I was disappointed.  It has a nice big dining area but the service is just horrible.  I didn\\'t expect to be waited on hand and foot but this was our service for the evening:\\n\\nWe come in, are seated right away (almost empty).  Gave us a teapot of tea and some peanuts.  Good so far.\\n\\nWe browse the menu and make our pick.  I asked a question and the lady server basically yells, \"what???\" with a really irritated tone.  I repeat myself and she says, \"no.\" No explanation, no suggestion of another dish, nothing.  OK, I know the whole language barrier thing first hand but that isn\\'t an excuse to lack customer service or be rude.  \\n\\nOK so the BF asks about the Fujian fried rice and asks if there is chicken, to not put any chicken.  We ask if there is other meat besides chicken.  Lady says, \"no.\" I order the bitter melon with garlic sauce.\\n\\nBitter melon with garlic sauce comes out.  No rice.  We wait 15 minutes before the fried rice comes out.  There is meat in it.  We ask the server, \"We ordered this with no chicken\".  She says, \"There is no chicken.\"  We pick up some chunks of poultry and ask, \"then what is this?\"  \"That\\'s duck.\"\\n\\nWTF?  /sigh/ Pros: good margherita pizza & wings; friendly workers\\n\\nCon: rude owner. Refused to acknowledge or greet us when we walked in. Called a worker over and stood there watching.\\n\\nOverall, the food is reasonably priced, but on the fence about returning. Rude rude rude. I called to inquire about an order I\\'ve been waiting for 3 hours for. The lady threatened to cancel my orde Was...OK. I had the steak and it was over cooked, which really surprised me for the price. Waiter disagreed with me when I said it was over cooked and charred on the outside. The prices on the menu were raised and changed with a pen, not very professional. Waiter couldn\\'t understand that we wanted 3 separate checks, but when we did explain he did get it correct. They also wouldn\\'t honor the happy hour prices in the restaurant so I went to the bar for my drinks and I got some interesting looks. Waiter was very attentive and professional (except for disagreeing with me on the steak). Went there on a Sunday AM for breakfast by myself. There was a short line for seating. I said that I was by myself; the folks behind me had two in their party. I watched as a small 2-person booth opened up. The folks behind me were seated. As they have nothing smaller than a 2-top, I wondered what was going on. Then the seater went across the room to a small table that sits practically in the hallway and started to set that. I suppose he thought I would be sitting at that rickety looking thing so everyone going up and down the hall could walk past, but instead I left. If they aren\\'t willing to accomodate single diners without sitting us in a crappy seat in the hall they should just put a big sign on their door so we know to go elsewhere. It\\'s not like they are the only place in town that can fix breakfast. I won\\'t be able to review the food since I won\\'t be going back. Have been here when it was La Tez, and sort of wish they would come back and/or go back to what they were doing.   Overall the food was ok, but everything was topped with the same beans and sauce combo.  We ordered the braised taquitos, smoked duck quesadillas, the scallops and blackened shrimp.  The duck was the best of the 4.  The taquitos were comparable to cheese steak egg rolls, my shrimp taco had literally 4 pieces of \"salsa\" in it (wife\\'s has a lot more), and they themselves just tasted like paprika....not blackened,  and I\\'ve made blackened.  The scallops were ok, but again, bland.  \\n\\nService: now I get it was Friday and a bit busy, but we were sat and after 15 minutes and HAVING TO ASK, we finally got a menu.  I didn\\'t get a chance to see the specials on the board since we were sat so fast so when I asked the waitress she rambled off two items which I could barely hear even though I could see the board had 4-5 things on it.    Food also beat the drink to the table.  On that, they used to have these great mixers in mason jars to add your tequila to.  I ordered the vida classic single glass, to which the server asked my wife, you mean a pitcher? So I responded, no just a single please.  Then She says to me (and when I say me, she is still talking to my wife like I\\'m not the one ordering), oh we\\'re out of the classic would you like one of the others....then there was odd silence until finally my wife says, I\\'m not getting one, what does he want? Anywho, got the pineapple which again came out after the food and was so full, I had to dump some to add tequila to it.   Also it was über sweet.   \\n\\nAs of now I\\'d never go back and that saddens me because I used to like the place and love edgemont.  Maybe get more servers on busy nights or at least servers that know how to serve. This was the worst Chinese food I have ever had.  It was so coated with flour or whatever it is they use before they cook the food that I could not eat it. The rice was disgusting.  It was so starchy and clumped together that it was impossible to eat.  Very bad food I ordered the whiting platter and found pieces of plastic in both pieces of fish. I contacted them and they couldn\\'t bother to respond. Luckily I ordered from a delivery service and they had the decency to refund my money, which I\\'m not sure the restaurant would\\'ve done had I dealt with them directly. Not only is it disgusting, but it\\'s a safety hazard. I\\'m lucky I didn\\'t choke or swallow the plastic but someone else might not be as lucky! We came here to celebrate a coworker\\'s birthday, and were very disappointed with the service. We put in our order at 12:05-12:10pm, and the first two dishes didn\\'t come out until 12:30-12:35. Then three other dishes came out around 12:45. The the last dish we ordered came at 12:50, right before we needed to leave. This last dish was supposed to be ordered GF/without bread, but it came out on a piece of bread and we had to send it back. \\n\\nThankfully, the waitress took off a drink and meal from our bill, but we will still greatly underwhelmed with the service and customer experience.\\n \\nThe food was good, but not worth the unfortunate service. \\n\\nWould love to see the restaurant work on this aspect of their business, because the location and interior is very promising. What a bummer! After eating here I wish I had looked through the reviews before seeing the 4 stars and assuming a good choice was made...\\n\\nThe food was good, though nothing special for the price and the service was atrocious. Once our pizza was served we didn\\'t see out server again. I\\'m glad I had the foresight to ration my one drink because another was not in the future. It wasn\\'t even packed, no reason for the lack of attention. Won\\'t be back. This place was disgusting and inedible. It turns my stomach thinking about it.\\n\\nWhen I bit into the chicken in my entree, I had to spit it out. The place was so dark I couldn\\'t fully examine the food I was trying to eat - nor should I ever have to!\\n\\nWhen I got home and looked at what had been boxed for me to take home, I noticed tails on the three of my chicken pieces. Since when do chicken pieces have tails?!\\n\\nI don\\'t know if this was their idea of a sick joke, but I am not laughing in the least! We came to La Peg around maybe 9 pm on a Friday night and the place was empty so you\\'d imagine service at the bar would be good... Well, the bartender kept referring to me as \"girl\" when he was talking to me (it probably happened 4-5 times), and then he never came back to take a drink order so all we got were brownies with a scoop of ice cream.\\n\\nThe brownies were fine but the bartender was terribly rude and I had no interest in getting anything anyway from him after that. Unless the service changes, I have I get it--it\\'s tough to make glueten-free baked goods--but they tasted awful, and it was like, $3 for a little cookie. Not impressed. Very slow service.  Our chef was funny and made the experience entertaining. The food was too salty, I think he just put too much soy sauce on it. The portions are very large. I love the salad dressing. Too price if you go after 7PM. After leaving a chipotle elsewhere because they were out of options, we arrived at this city line location. Not only was it an absolute mess with food on all the tables and trash everywhere, but at 9 pm they were out of corn salsa, guacamole and chips. Multiple people came in after us as well. Poor customer retention if this continues. Giant is losing 2 stars! What\\'s up with their prices lately? When I moved to this area a year ago, both lemons and avocados were significantly cheaper than they are now. Lemons have gone up by $0.50. Also, their grass-fed ground beef has become more expensive as well, by $1. \\n\\nI used to come here because I could spend less for more; slowly, but surely, this is not the case any longer. Lately I find myself shopping at Wegman\\'s more and more often, and I haven\\'t spend more dollars than what I would spend at Giant. \\n\\nAnother weird thing: some staff members aren\\'t as friendly (mostly new people), and some of the older ones stopped saying hello altogether. \\n\\nI\\'ll keep Giant as my emergency store, as I live down the street, but I dread going here lately and do most of my shopping at Wegman\\'s. Um, this is a transplanted chain from Boston, but here\\'s the catch: it\\'s not in Boston so the seafood isn\\'t Boston-quality.  Like Ali E. said, you have to go to the real Legal up north.  Here, it should be renamed Illegal Sea Foods.  The clam chowder was the only semi-edible dish.  The tuna steak was dry and overdone, and the gumbo was bland.  It gets 2 stars because our server was very attentive and pleasant, and for the clam chowder, which is better than the bowls served at the other restaurants in the area.  If you\\'re in the mood for quality seafood, I would recommend heading elsewhere. I wish I had read the reviews here and comments before going to this place- both my friend and I had our IPhones stolen last night! Which is crazy considering we go out every weekend to other bars and this was our first time here- no wonder staff didn\\'t seem surprised... It\\'s just another person getting their stuff stolen ... I\\'m just surprised how they haven\\'t closed this place down - it\\'s obvious something shady is happening when thefts happen repeatedly. this is my first time writing a review but I am so angry right now I just want people to know- don\\'t go here there\\'s many other places in the city- the risk of having something of value stolen is just not worth it. The tap room use to be a great place to go. A few years ago I would have given it 5 stars without a second thought. These days it\\'s a last option for the days we when are too lazy to travel for something better.\\n The menu has gone from extreme and controversial (days of lion) to short and so boring its hard to find something worth ordering. I\\'m ok with the menu being short, but if you can\\'t keep that little in stock and cooked correctly there is a real problem in the kitchen. \\nThe staff is never friendly these days. Everyone seems angry and bothered by everything especially customers. I\\'m sorry, but if I want someone to be annoyed at my requests for service I\\'ll go to my mom\\'s house. I\\'m not a fan of paying good money for eye roles and a snotty attitude. \\n The beer list is just about the only good thing about the place. They seem to still be bringing in new choices all the time. It might just be my luck, but I usually have to switch my drink during the evening when they run out. Unfortunately for the Tap Room  these days I can find a similar list of beer just about anywhere. \\nNothing special going on here. Some days are better then others, but when I go out I want to have a nice time. The food is OK, similar to Kilimandjaro on Chestnut. The Yassa fish was not too fresh, the rice---spicy and dry. It took us almost 90 minutes to get  the food after we ordered. Maybe they were having an off night, but I don\\'t plan on going back any time soon. I thought this restaurant was overrated.  Definately does not live up to the hype.  Food is fine, just not as spectacular as people said.  Ambience is also lame.  Tables for two about as small as a newspaper.  Don\\'t get all the fuss. My husband and I enjoy supporting our local restaurants, and last week, it was Cheu\\'s turn. I\\'m not usually the type of person to leave a bad review, but we were so disappointed, we had to.   The flavors of the foods we ordered were good, and the servers were really nice; with that said, our disappointments came from the cost and portions of the food.  I ordered the salmon rice bowl which cost was $15. I received about 1/2 cup of rice with mixed grains,  a few leaves of mixed greens, 1 slice of roasted squash, and about 2 table spoons of minced salmon. Seriously, that was all! Not even a full portion of salmon. I was still hungry when I left. My husband ordered the brisket ramen which was also $15; he was served a bowl of noodles with 2 tiny sliced medallions of brisket! That\\'s it.  We also went during Happy Hour, when drinks are supposed to be discounted. We ordered 2 glasses of the house red, they were $7 each! That is the normal cost of a glass of wine in most restaurants! How is that a Happy Hour price? Our bill came to $82, we did shared an appetizer, which was the best part of the meal. Honestly, we had spent less money and eaten way more at other places. We were so shocked, we paid the bill, tipped and left with no intentions of coming back. The worst part is that we were both hungry less than an hour later. Heck, you spend $82 anywhere else and you go home full and satisfied. I still can\\'t believe that $15 only bought me 2 table spoons of salmon, w.t.h? It is too bad, because like I said, they food had good flavors. The cost, was not worth it though. Not at all.  We won\\'t be back. I could have eaten 2 ducks,  or a whole turkey with that money. If you want to throw away your money, this is the place to do it. The good: \\nClean studio\\nPlenty of space\\nDecent workout (6/10 in terms of intensity) \\nSculpting work is good (7/10)\\n\\nThe bad:\\n-some classes require moving around the room and people tend to bump into each other. Instructors do little to help with that\\n- the resistance bands are haphazardly tied to the bar and not in great shape. Honestly a little gross. Not sure how often they are cleaned. \\n-mats are atrocious and slip around the whole room\\n- I witnessed people with incorrect technique multiple times and was never corrected \\n- owner is a little flakey and unprofessional (swiffers during class)\\n- classes almost always start late which is, again, unprofessional. \\n\\nWill I go back? Probably not. Not a terrible place though, if you go just watch your form. nobody else is going to. Food was great, male server was terrible!!! We saw him twice the entire night... asked for extra bread from three different people and never got it.  The bussers and hostess were great, but this server was one of the worst we\\'ve had.  No wonder why graces couldn\\'t make it.  I\\'ve been here twice before and never had this problem. Never again! While the food is decent, the prices are exorbitant. Just had a $12 \"canal\" salad for lunch. The tomatoes were anemic and the chicken was flavorless. Wouldn\\'t let us sit down because we had ordered drinks at the bar. If they had done anything to express the special rules BEFORE we had ordered it would have been fine but instead they came off as pricks. Plenty of more chill places in the area if you just want a quick drink. Can\\'t say I was impressed enough by anything else there to put up with staff that rude. I don\\'t know, this is one of those places that used to be really good and had these great portions you could appreciate because you wanted to eat their food 2 days in a row.  Now, not so much, it just a big pile of \\'its ok\\' so it comes across as wasteful and expensive.  In our last order the only thing I enjoyed was the antipasto. So we frequent this place. By that I mean, every single weekend we grab some bagel sandwiches. Perfect location, great job done by the first owner. Now, not so much.\\nLet me say first of all, the bagels are fantastic. The RUDE STAFF, is not. Rude, rude, rude. HUGE staff, some of who just seem to be there.\\nThe facility needs to be cleaner and updated. The storage of the outside tables and umbrellas in the entrance is tacky and, well, lazy.\\nLazy seems to be the general attitude.\\nBagels are good, but paint the place, wipe it down, put the tables away, and GET SOME MANNERS.\\nAlso, $13 for two bagels is ridiculous. When you try calling the store there\\'s like 3 minute message you have to wait through, followed by the same message in Spanish. I guess I\\'m not getting anyone on the phone today^ Food? Meh.  I have hesitated writing a review thinking maybe it was.me. maybe it was the day I went.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing.  Today\\'s experience sealed the fate.  The coffee is ok. Maybe the tea.is better? The food is.overpriced ($7 for a piece of whole wheat bread with cream cheese on it? You have to be kidding me? ), items are brought to the table, sometimes, sometimes not.    For the love of all things holy, stop trying to improve on warm pita.  Oregano, salt, and oil are not improvements if someone wants to nosh on hummus.  Yuck.  You might consider offering more pita as well.  Annoying. The place is filthy.   Not.much of an issue if I am there to.listen to music, but kind of gross if I am there to eat. If you\\'re a working class grunt like most of us city folk then you want to avoid this place altogether. $6.00 12 oz Yuengling Lagers, no view of the city skyline, young wealthy douchebags. I doubt you can find a more standoff-y place in the city. The best part of the night was when they brought out fur blankets to combat the chill. It was fun to act like Jon Snow for a little. Don\\'t go here. Food is ok. Only burrito/Mexican place in the neighborhood. Most of the workers are rude. Went to the Sunday brunch buffet yesterday for my bday celebration. The food is really good, but this experience made me realize how unsanitary buffets really are. Everyone touching the same serving utensils or even using their hands...and I\\'m certain they don\\'t wash their hands before eating. I was disappointed that they were out of the smoked salmon and a few other items. My girls made me feel special, but the waiter certainly didn\\'t. That wouldn\\'t typically bother me, but he asked us if we were celebrating, and this was followed up with an \"ok\". \\n\\nI did enjoy myself, but I wouldn\\'t go back and in hindsight, I wish I chose a different restaurant. I don\\'t see any more brunch buffets in my future. The food is mediocre at best. I realize this is a chain, but if I\\'m paying $8 for glorified chicken wings I expect them to at least be served on a plate and not in a cardboard container. The fried pickles were good enough. The spinach artichoke dip was obviously just microwaved as the center was still ice cold. \\n\\nService was worse than the food. Our waitress forgot to bring one of the main meals out and didn\\'t realize for ten mins. Also we had to ask for utensils and napkins after our food was served. Overall, the waitress was completely inattentive and seemed to not care at all. \\n\\nOur bill for three appetizers, a burger and a single beer came to $42. Not even remotely worth it. I hadn\\'t been here for 20 years  but it  was good when i last visited and you dont stay open for 30 years if youre bad  ya know? So i was in the neighborhood a week or so ago and figured I\\'d stop in for some eggs and coffee . Big mistake! I ordered two eggs , home fries , pork roll and coffee simple .....i ate breakfast and headed back to to office 10 minutes away by the time i got there i was deathly ill.....you guessed it ....food poisoning most likely from the pork roll . I was laid up with stomach and gastro disturbances for 2 days. I will never go back. What a nightmare .....hate to leave bad reviews but i would hate to see someone else have that happen to them .....beware I\\'m not sure what to say about this place... upon entering this small, shotgun style space you can see a lot of thought went into the decor and design. From the color of the walls to the leather bound booklet style menus, I felt like we were in for a good experience.\\n\\nThat went downhill as soon as the salty bar manager plopped herself next to us and positioned herself in front of a plethora of cocktails to \"taste.\" She didn\\'t do much tasting, instead bitched about her employees, was rude to the delivery guy, and was just overall nasty - even towards us, the patrons! I\\'m sorry, I understand this is one person and I will say our actual bartender was a sweetheart, but this is the woman they have chosen to represent their bar. Worst branding decision the owner ever made.\\n\\nPositive note - the cocktails were decent and the food looked like it would have been tasty... if we had any reason to stay any longer. The line for this place was incredibly long, so I decided to get my cheesesteak here, without consulting yelp. That was a mistake. \\n\\nTo be fair, I didn\\'t get sick from my food. But after waiting close to 30 minutes for my food, I\\'m expecting something amazing. I got the cheesesteak, with whiz, peppers, onions and mushrooms. I guess because I ordered it with a few things extra, they decided to let 6 people cut in front of me and get their sandwiches first. I was not a fan of that. \\n\\nWhen we finally ate our sandwiches, my friends and I all agreed. They were flavorless. The steak sandwiches at Subways are 100x better than what we ate here. I don\\'t understand why the line for this place is so long. Post note: it\\'s been nine days since my last horrible review I even called again but was put off the Manager again wasn\\'t there out again I guess he was delivering pizza in Tibet I mean he is gone so much tells you a lot of the decline in service. I will say I miss the food it was great but after nine years of loyal patronage and the way I was treated please go to Solly Pizza or Aldo pizza the later worth the pick up only. Where do i begin?\\n\\nI was on my way back home from a long drive from PA back to NY and decided that I was in the mood for some Pho; looked on yelp and found this restaurant with great reviews. \\n\\n1) First off i\\'d like to say Great decor, nice cozy spot inside right off a strip with a small parking space. Lights are dim and place looks very clean to set the atmosphere.\\n\\n2) Customer service is not the best or friendliest. The staffs look very unhappy to be there... at least smile and pretend please.\\n\\n3) Being a native New Yorker our expenses are high; so when I go to another state things seem to be a bit cheaper then I\\'m used to.. boy was I wrong. The waiter sat us down; received 2 glasses of water. This is the first time in my life where I had to step into a Pho Restauraunt and had to pay for Hot Tea - 2 small Cups $3.00; maybe I\\'m too used to stepping into Asian cuisines where hot-tea was always on the house. Oh well no big deal I guess right?\\n\\n4) I ordered a combination Pho bowl - $12.. A bit pricey.. I was expecting a bigger portion for this price margin (In NYC.. I can get a bowl the same size for only 8.95 the most $10). The broth was on the salty side with alot of  MSG. Noodles seem a bit overcooked because they were super thin and lost their thick texture. Overall the Pho was okay; but not the greatest to represent this signature dish. To be honest I was disappointed..  I would like to say if I\\'m ever around this area again I won\\'t repeat. For various reasons such as: Lack of customer-service; High price for average - to below average Pho noodles. I\\'ve been to this place a few times and live in Newtown. It has never been my scene but I thought I should yelp a review. The bartender assumed I had a few drinks in me and decided to substitute a single for a ten when returning my change.  I will not be returning. Underwhelmed and over priced! Portions were small and food was mediocre. \\nWaitress almost forgot our Caesar salads; shame she remembered; dressing was disappointing. Ordered the fish of the day as recommended by her and couldn\\'t believe how fishy and obviously frozen it had been. Don\\'t waste your time! Don\\'t let the website, menu, or tap list fool you -- on three occasions, the beef and chicken burritos gave us severe GI issues.  On our last visit, we purchased an expensive beer release after it was played up by the owner, only to later hear him brag to his bar staff about how he was able to sell that last beer that sat in the refrigerator for months to someone that didn\\'t know any better.  Frustrating experience for those interested in a genuine dining and drinking experience.  Stay far away. I stopped in for (take out) lunch today since this area is a barren wasteland for take out and I thought I\\'d try some place new.   I ordered a buffalo chicken cheesesteak.  When I got home and unwrapped my lunch, what I saw was simply asinine.  The \"cheese steak\" was made up chicken breasts (seemingly boiled?) which were diced into HUGE cubes and laden with fat.  The hot sauce was scant, oily, and watery and if there was indeed blue cheese, it wasn\\'t noticeable.  I was starving and couldn\\'t continuing eating anymore after 5 mins.\\n\\nWhy must things be unnecessarily complicated?  Why try to make a chicken cheese steak differently than literally every other restaurant makes them?\\n\\nI took a look at their taps when I was waiting for my food and was unimpressed.  This was around noon on a Friday and the place was quite crowded.  The vibe I got was blue collar-y and non-blue collars weren\\'t really welcome.  Christ this area needs a few good bars and take out spots bad! If I could give it no star I would! This was the worse Italian food I have ever had! The pasta sauce taste like water and there was no flavor! And TO TOP IT OFF there was a small brown roach crawling on our table! I told one of the server, and she snatches a red napkin off of the table next to us. Lifts the bread, smashes and slides it off the table under the napkins. Then sits the Bread back down! No apologies, no comps, nothing! NEVER AGAIN Will I eat here! This restaurant needs to be on a restaurant take over show! Oh and in the world of technology, they ONLY take CASH! What!!! Extremely underwhelming.  The red coconut curry had very little flavor, especially in proportion to the spice level.  I did not enjoy my meal.  However, I have had a Honeygrow salad at another location and it was quite delicious.  Not sure if the problem today was the location or the stir-fry I chose.  Either way, I am coming away disappointed and un satisfied. We were a party of 7 celebrating my parents 60th anniversary. I had requested a table that had a nice atmosphere. We were seated at a table in the front room that seemed to have been lit by the odd gas lamp. It was next to impossible to see each other let alone the menu or food. I don\\'t know what the objective was except perhaps to seem as though the room exuded \"colonial charm\" instead of shining a light on how very dated it is. The food was ok, not bad and not exceptional, and the service spotty. I was disappointed especially since this was a happy occasion, we were all dressed, but could barely see each other and it was impossible to take photos. The service was slow. The \"fresh brewed iced tea was disgusting. The margarita flat bread was bad. The tomatoes and cheese were uncooked. Horrible customer service. For example, I ordered a bagel one day in the morning. There was only one other customer in the store. I waited for almost 20 minutes before someone realized I was waiting and found the girl who was working the deli in the back. Other times I\\'ve ordered food I\\'ve had to bring it back bc they messed it up. It seems like if the Store Manager isn\\'t there then they just stand around talking especially the younger employees.\\n\\nTrevose Location on Brownsville Rd. Zero stars is what this place deserves. The lady with blonde hair who answered the phone was a rude bitch. Told me my totally was $12 and some change. She hung up before even asking if that was all i wanted. It wasn\\'t. When i got there she charged me $16 when online it says $12 and that\\'s exactly what she told me my total was. Make up your fucking mind. She had zero customer service. All she did was complain about ringing up online orders. And as for the pizza. It was horrible. Saggy and super oily. If you want a new pizza place i suggest Tony pizza in north wales or at least new station pizza. Screw this place and customer service. Stopped in with my grandson the other night as I remembered how great the outside deck was and wanted him (18yrs) to have the experience. I was disappointed that it was a half-hour wait so we settled downstairs. Waitress approached us and was pleasant enough and brought us water and that was the last we saw her. A waiter then took our order and seemed to \"suffer\" through the food questions my grandson posed, he\\'s very specific when he orders.  I had the cheesesteak sandwich which I remembered as being awsome with long strips of steak topped with mozzerella. This time it was awful - steak  was in pieces that were extremely salty and no presence of cheese. My grandson ordered the arugula pizza which didn\\'t have any sauce, which he specifically asked for - with added mushrooms. At $18 it was \"anything but special,\" he said.  There\\'s a plethora of staff running around but apparently not enough chefs as my grandson waited 25min. for his pizza while I was finished with my sandwich.  Will go back just for a deink on the deck - perhaps. Sat at the bar on a Friday night around 7:30- Matt at the bar on Friday was rude didn\\'t help explain the menu and was not attentive at all. The shrimp toast is NOT hot and the food was sub par though it did come out quickly. Other bartenders were really sweet which helped make this a pleasant experience. Rude, overpriced, and dirty. The quaintness of an Irish Pub should not supersede health codes and a basic desire to not serve tainted food.  You are in the service industry, try actually serving. order chicken drunken noodles for the second time from this restaurant. both times it made me really sick. i feel this kind of sickness after consuming high amounts of MSG. food was tasteless.  i love vietnamese food but i am never going back to pho. came here for drinks and cigar on a saturday night...place was very crowded...they advertise with state of the art air filtering system for the cigar smoke...but it seemed like it couldn\\'t keep up with packed house with everyone smoking up the cigar inside.  We put our name down for a table...but waited over 2 hours to get table...while waiting...we ended up getting a drinks and a cigar...and smoke on the floor...yes i know...this is cigar bar...but guy to girl ratio was about 20 to 1...lol...not a good place to meet girls...they did had a great selection with scotch...but price was on the bit of high end...I would definitely try it out sometime during weekdays...perhaps i can actually get an nice table to enjoy my single malt and a cigar.. Food is poor quality and tasteless. I would never order from him again. There are so many other great places but I wanted to give these guys a shot. Turns out, not all shots result in success. Totally underwhelmed for lunch today.  Very bland basic salad with mushy \"crabcake\"  Definitely not worth going back to. Very rude staff. Went there and the hostess was annoyed we didn\\'t have a reservation and we were told to go to the bar as if we were punished. Stood at the bar and waited 10 min while the bar tender ignored us and made others drinks finally got to us and I wanted a water and he seemed annoyed that I only wanted a water poured me water from a pitcher that had been sitting on the bar with NO ice or anything and ignored my fiancé and wouldn\\'t take his order. Needless to day we left.... Absolute rip off. Their tacos are SO SMALL and the worker very sloppily made them, they are almost inedible because they fall apart. Save your money and go somewhere else Bleh!!  That\\'s all I have to say...\\n\\nAlright...here\\'s a little more explanation.  \\n\\nAfter coming back from a long trip, all I wanted to do was settle into my couch with some good Chinese take-out.  I could have gone with my old faithful, JoJo Place, but instead I thought to myself....what if I\\'m missing out on some really good Chinese?  How would I know?  So I took a chance and order from A Mandarin.  Bad Move!!!!\\n\\nKnowing how much I love leftover Chinese I ordered wonton soup, general tso\\'s, and steamed veg dumplings.  All basics!  How could you go wrong?!!\\n\\nThe wontons in the soup had a very odd color to them, but I put that aside and tried them out.  They were very chewy and the soup had a weird after taste.\\n\\nThe only positive of the general tso\\'s was that the broccoli was on the side.  The meat itself was completely dried out.\\n\\nAnd the steamed dumplings....thick and mushy and I\\'m still confused as to what the vegetable resemblance was.\\n\\nNot good!!!  Stick to JoJo Place....it\\'s only a block away. We had a terrible experience coming here. I was so excited to try this restaurant because I wanted a new go to option for eating healthy and conveniently. I walked in and thought - this is cute, this is going to be great! But the cashier had an attitude. And we waited close to 20 minutes for our take out order. 4 people who ordered behind us got their food first and it was apparent that they had forgotten our order. It was just two salads! The chicken for the salads comes in foil bundles, and it was tasty (especially the onions) but a paltry volume considering the price. The chicken was also not carefully portioned and one bundle had one third more volume than the other. And even with all the extra time the order took to make, they forgot the farro and beans in the Live Med Salad. Huge disappointment. We won\\'t be going back. Italian hoagie was very weak. Can get a better one at wawa. The roll sucked and way too much lettuce. Don\\'t think I\\'ll ever go back. Not for me. Food was not good and neither was the service.  Food took forever to come out. It\\'s one of those places where they serve the food as it\\'s ready from the kitchen. This can be fine if everyone else\\'s food comes out within a reasonable timeframe. This was not the case here. My one friend\\'s food came out so long after everyone else\\'s that we were all finished eating by the time she got it. If you\\'re on your lunch break, forget it. Vegetarian options are very limited and carb heavy or just salads. Everyone at the table tried the kumquats in my dish and no one liked how they tasted. Perhaps smaller pieces or just the zest would have been better- very strong flavor. Only nice part was the decor. I have nice decor at home and would rather eat there! Stopped by here last night for the first time looking for a place to grab a drink on their roof deck.  We were told it would be about 25 minutes so we took a seat at the downstairs bar.  It would have been nice if someone had told us there was an upstairs bar, since most of the workers seemed annoyed that we were downstairs.  \\n\\nThe tap list was decent, but nothing to go out of the way for.  After sitting there for a while, we started to notice that people walking in were being taken right up to the roof deck and seated.  When we were finally taken up to the deck to the roof to sit, we sat for 10 minutes without being asked if we wanted anything to drink or eat.  We got up and left.  \\n\\nTwo stars exist because the roof deck is nice and its buy one get one craft beer if you check in on your yelp app. Picked up Italian hoagie. Three bites in still waiting for the taste of the meat to kick in. If you drift my follow it\\'s a salad. Overpriced will not be going back. Good music. Good beer. Good fries. Veggie burger.....ahhhhh not so much. It was mushy....so not cool. \\n\\nWe ordered veggie burgers. Took 30 minutes to come out and they bring two regular burgers. Reordered with veggie burgers and that took 40 minutes. And they were mushy. Mushy to the point where it was falling apart as soon as you picked up the burger. The manager said its like that because they make them in house and sear them in a pan. Still wouldn\\'t make it mushy. \\n\\nGlad I live in Cali I won\\'t be back here anytime soon. Ok, so has this placed closed down or something? Went there today...after 5pm and the curtains we\\'re drawn shut and door locked. What is up? Walked by here last Fri & it looks like they\\'ve closed\\n\\nAte here a couple years ago & it was not good or worth it, even with a Groupon deal If you\\'re going to play the \"slow food\" card, the flavors need to deliver. \\n\\nI started with the Greek Salad. This came with my entree. The salad was relatively fresh. I enjoyed the Greek dressing. It was rich, smooth, and very well balanced in flavor. Often Greek dressing is overwhelmed by Feta. This was not so. \\n\\nThe sausage platter was quite underwhelming. It came with two small butterflied sweet sausage links. The portion was disappointingly small. The meat was underseasoned and had no interesting flavor. It was cooked a bit further than needed. \\n\\nSome of the potatoes were ok, others were undercooked. They had no interesting flavor and the bite was often harsh. I\\'d love to see the integration of garlic and rosemary into this side. The Tzatziki did not make sense for this dish. It didn\\'t pair well with anything on the plate because all the flavors were very weak and the Tzatziki just overpowered them with its clean cool flavor. \\n\\nThe pita was just OK. It didn\\'t taste anything other than store-bought pita thrown on the plancha. It was thin, harsh of the bite, and had no fluff.  I\\'ve had much better pita. \\n\\nI appreciate what the owners are attempting to do. I\\'m OK with a 3-hour meal. But I have had better Greek carryout. This food isn\\'t worth sitting down for, certainly not for 3 hours. What about this place makes it Canadian/Montreal? \\n\\nDisappointing. Deeply. Not good, slightly pricey and small portions. \\n\\nWith Royal Tavern and Good King Tavern a few blocks away, Coeur is going to need to get better quickly or it will be the latest place to fail in this location.\\n\\nOur service was good. My experience at Lourdas last Saturday night can only be described as surreal.  We\\'ve frequented the restaurant for about 10 years and almost always have had good meals.  Service has been spotty at times, but never terrible.  Last Saturday night we were seated next to a couple on one side with whom we pleasantly conversed and I told the woman how wonderful the lentil soup was.  She ordered it and loved it too.  To my left was a 5-top and I knew two of the patrons.  As we stood up to leave, one of them asked what I\\'d ordered.  I responded and said that I was very happy with my fish.  I don\\'t recall if I was asked about the lentil soup (which I didn\\'t order that night), but if I had been asked, undoubtedly would have responded that it was one of the best around.  \\n\\nFast forward maybe 45 minutes.  My phone rang and the woman at the other end began to berate me, voice raised, never coming up for air, saying that how dare I act as a \"food critic\" and tell a customer (as reported by her server) not to order the lentil soup!  Not only would that have been the exact opposite of what I\\'d say, but I\\'d recommended it to the person on the other side of us, and hello.....everyone who dines in any restaurant is a food critic of that restaurant & any other they visit.  She went on to rant that henceforth I was unwelcome at Lourdas.  To say that I was shaken by her bizarre behavior is an understatement.  This woman owes me a serious apology!  Needless to say, welcome or unwelcome, Lourdas is off our list. There are too many good restaurants in this city to put up with something like that.  Restauranteurs, chefs, and managers with whom I\\'ve spoken were in shock at her lack of professionalism.\\n\\nI\\'ve given one star because our food was tasty.  Otherwise there would be none because of the owner\\'s outrageous behavior.\\n\\nUpdate:  Not a word of apology.  Upon reflection, she did us a favor.  We\\'ve since found a go-to restaurant where the food is better, the service phenomenal, the prices lower, and the vibe perfect. Cheap beer and passable bar food but disconcerting issue with the digital jukebox. Minor it may seem to most, but filtering out basically any music made by a minority. Tried to test it and see if it\\'s what can somehow be found offensive but Boys II Men is filtered. Seriously, who filters that? Some will understand the concern and others won\\'t. Overpriced. Soggy, greasy tasteless fries. Burger was good but greasy and too expensive for quality. Cook staff at opening today eating fries with gloves on. Mayo and other perishable opened condiments in squeezable bottles were on the counter unrefrigerated and the restaurant was HOT!!! Where was the manager he/she needs to provide food safety training!!!! This restaurant is not what it used to be.  Portions are smaller and the food not great anymore. The potatoes au gratin used to be delish and was a large side.  Now it\\'s a little scoop and not that good.  My cocktail was all watered down.  Tasted like a glass of water.  We won\\'t be back. I really don\\'t \"get\" this place. I do have some sort of connection to it other than living in the NE. Both my niece and nephew have worked here (and the one at Parx). When they expanded the upstairs at the original, my father and I were hired by Pete to do the hardwood floors. Hell, we did the floors @ Pete\\'s house and his brother\\'s, too. I, unlike a lot of people, don\\'t have a beef with Pete. I envy and look up for him for turning a ho-hum corner bar into a extremely $uccessful regional chain of ho-hum bars. He\\'s the quintessential self-promoter.\\n\\nThis location is always too busy. Too crowded. Wait times on the weekends are 60 to 90 minutes, easy. Not worth the wait.\\n\\nThe crab fries are nothing more than frozen crinkled fries sprinkled with Old Bay. *yawn* The cajun fries at the Grey Lodge Pub are so much better... fresh cut, too, not frozen Or-Ida crap.\\n\\nThe crabs, well, they do ship them in relatively fresh, but I\\'m all about driving to Maryland for crabs caught the same day, not airlifted from the Gulf.\\n\\nThe mussels are HUGE. If you know anything about mussels, you know that bigger is NOT better. And, mussels in marinara is boring as hell. How about a beer based broth, Pete?\\n\\nTheir beer selection sucks. The usual macro-swill and I believe their best sellers are Miller Lite and Yuengling Lager in bottles. Blah.\\n\\nChicken parm sandwich is always dry. The cheesesteak is choked down with melted American. Barely edible. The rest of the menu is a slight notch above anything you\\'d find at chains like Applebee\\'s.\\n\\nJust proof that my fellow NE Philadelphians have low expectations, no taste buds and are quite happy and simple about that. They are rude and nasty!  The chili is inedible and the french fries are soggy.  This used to be a fun place to go and the food was good.  Now it is the worst! The drinks are good, but the food left a lot to be desired. All the dishes came out at once, so most got cold by the time our party of 4 got to eating them. Our server did tell us the kitchen would send food as it was ready; I\\'ve been to many places with a similar protocol, but getting all our plates at once was a new experience that really made for an unpleasant meal. We felt extremely rushed. Please don\\'t put the kitchen\\'s inability to course out dishes ahead of diners\\' enjoyment. \\n\\nService- There is a bar downstairs where we had great service. Our server did an awesome job recommending drinks and seemed to really know the menu. Upstairs for our meal was a different story. The server there seemed really indifferent- we told him we\\'d had a beer we really enjoyed downstairs but couldn\\'t quite remember the name. He told us to read the beer list. Not very helpful.\\n\\nAmbience- super sceney! I felt uncomfortable. Very dim lighting. Lots of high heels.\\n\\nThe only dish we really liked were the meatballs. We also shared the large steak dish ($68) and would not recommend at all. Foie, crudo, pork pasta, and octopus pizza rounded out our meal- all were just ok. And so for the price, probably won\\'t be back for them. The very front of their menu says \"Fast Delivery\".  I guess an hour and 15 minutes is what they consider \"Fast.\"  Also, they are very nonchalant about their lax delivery... I loved aromatic (this was the spot before it became Leyla) It was Persian and delicious.  I am also a very big fan of Turkish food... so though I was disappointed to see Aromatic gone, I was still excited to have the change for Turkish.  I cannot express how sad I am that I ate here.  Nothing was right.  The rice was full of oil.. so gross, my kabob was dry and terrible and instead of the spicy roasted hot peppers (a big part of Turkish food) they tried to give me bell peppers as a replacement... even though the photo of the dish on their menu showed the traditional hot peppers.  I will never go back.  The waiter was incredibly nice and charming but that is not enough to make up for bad food.  No way around that. I ordered delivery to the hotel I was staying at, and read a lot of reviews both on Yelp and GrubHub about how great Kabuki was. However I really don\\'t understand the hype. My dinner left me with a slight stomach ache and was just not very good. \\n\\nI ordered the Sushi Pizza because I was super intrigued. This was probably the best thing I ordered, however I could not eat a lot of it as the flavors got pretty old. I also ordered a Spicy Tuna Roll and Marriott Roll. The Spicy Tuna was meh, just mushed up Tuna and spicy sauce. The Marriott Roll was kind of the same thing, just meh. The tempura shrimp wasn\\'t very warm and the coating was so thick I felt like I was just eating breading. \\n\\nOverall, I wouldn\\'t order or visit this place again. I\\'ve had much better sushi in Wisconsin. Wow.....  Just waited 10 minutes on hold for the host to answer take my request for information go back on hold for 3 minutes and her to come back and say \"how can I help you\". After after another bout of hold to be told \"sorry we don\\'t have any reservations for that day until 9:30PM. If you haven\\'t been to this Target in a while, you may want to consider visiting it. I work nearby and usually go between the hours of 11am and 2pm, when it is less crowded. Over the summer, there was construction being done, which made the shopping experience absolutely horrible. Certain items were moved in completely different areas as a result of construction work which was being done. You would go in one week and a certain item would be in one area, then the next week or so, that item would be in a completely different place. Sometimes, it would be in a section that made absolutely no sense. For example, protein bars would be in a section with notebooks. Now that the construction is done, I have to say it\\'s now a very attractive Target. \\n\\nAs soon as you walk in, you\\'ll notice just how huge and open the store looks. There are very clean restrooms to your right, including a family restroom for those shopping with the little ones. To your left is Starbucks. There was always a Starbucks in this Target, but now it looks better and has more seating. Oddly enough, there\\'s a Starbucks literally around the corner within two minutes walking distance or less. \\n\\nPost construction, there are now more self-checkout machines. I haven\\'t officially counted, but from what I recall, there are roughly 10 machines. The grocery section has been vastly improved, with much more selections. I recommend it if you\\'re in the area. My husband and I wanted to try a New Mexican place. We were recommended something that was similar to fajitas but it wasn\\'t very good. It was supposed to be steak but tasted like salami. We asked to change it but they said they would charge us. We also got something that was similar to a hard shell taco which was ok. None of the food came with any beans or rice. No chips and salsa on the house. Not my cup of tea. This location NEVER has it together. Always out of everything, 20-30 minutes for 1 sandwich, you have to remind the cashier your waiting and she has to remind the preparers in the back that a customer is waiting for food (they look clueless at all times) And today there was no ice in the ice machine.... just close the location... it\\'s such a disappointment We went to the restaurant on Friday for a special occasion celebration. We were a couple and were sitter right away.\\n\\nIn the bar area there was live music not too loud but  i would prefer the audio system playing.\\nWe ordered a wine glass and a sangria together with some appetizers. The restaurant was not full. It took over ten minutes until we received our drink order. \\nThe oysters were good. The crostini was missing seasoning.\\nMy hubby ordered lobster ravioli while i ordered their special of black pasta with fish, mussels and half a lobster. \\nWhen we received main course my husbands ravioli was great however my special which cost 30+ was overcooked. I was looking for the waitress the manager came and took the plate to redo the lobster. In the mean time my husband finished his meal because it got cold. So I ended up packing my whole meal and not eating it. \\nThen we ordered dessert and coffee.\\nWhen I tried eating my packed meal the next day it was even worse then the initial one. This is extremely frustrating. We came to celebrate however I ended up having only appetizer and a dessert. And I had to throw away the meal I paid for. Wasted money and evening. Stay as far away from this place as you can! While the food itself was average. The problem lies within their customer service. After hearing good things about this place, we felt it was worth a shot. How wrong we were. Once we arrived (not very crowded) we ordered 4 bagels with cream cheese. Nothing special. 20 mins later we still have not gotten our order. \\nFinally after complaining several times we finally got the order and it was WRONG. At that point we left and will never go back again. What makes the nightmare truly complete was the owner chased us into the parking lot and tried to explain why the order got messed up. \\nAt that point we did not want to hear why the order got messed up we just wanted to leave. Then 2 customers leaving the restaurant berated us for complaining about our experience. The owner then called me an expletive and we left. Needless to say there will not be a return trip. But hey if you like being berated and treated poorly, then by all means head to this place. However if you want a better customer experience then stay away. Got a salad here some years back, but I haven\\'t been here in a while. The food is still pretty good and prices are average. What sucks is the service. First when I called to place the order the guy was rushing me off the phone. I asked about the types of dressings they had and he said that there were too many to name (once I get here they\\'re only 8 dressings which is average, but not too many to name). He seemed irritated as if he didn\\'t feel like being bothered with questions which I only had that one. \\nOnce I get her. I asking the female cashier about beverages and she just starts blurting out the total of my order. So I say excuse me and she does it again, at which point I ask her what\\'s she talking about and she says the total. To which I respond how about answering my beverage question since I would like to purchase one. \\nI\\'m not sure who\\'s in charge here, but they need to train their staff on excellent customer service skills. \\nAs a business owner my staff would NEVER act this way and expect to keep their job. We normally eat at the restaurant but this time I placed an order for takeout since we didn\\'t have the time to eat in. They told me it would be ready in 20 minutes. When I walked into the restaurant they directed me to the bar for takeout orders. The bar area was NOT busy at all and two girls were working the bar area. I ended up having to wait over 15 minutes to get my food and actually had to ask what the hold up was. What\\'s the point of ordering takeout if you still have to wait the same amount of time to pick it up? The manager was standing within ear shot and said nothing. What a great way to treat paying customers. When I got to my car I noticed that the salad dressing had spilled all over the bag and into the main entrée. Great job of packaging the food. The food was over priced for what we received. Fusion is an awful restaurant the food is bad and the people are worse if you want a terrible dining experience go to this restaurant. I got very sick every time I ate their food don\\'t eat at this restaurant! man i was excited because i actually enjoy PF Changs although it is fake chinese food.  Pei Wei has a nice atmosphere but the food is ridiculously salty.  My friend order some Vietnamese Spring Roll which is a mistake. I\\'m viet and never order vietnamese spring rolls in a fusion place. the rest of the stuff was SUPER salty.  my friend order the pad thai, ok but too salty to eat.  My Kung Pao chicken was so salty i wanted to douse my tea on it and wash off the sauce.  we sent the food back and although it was less salty it was still inedible.  i dont know how the people around us were eating this crap.  the managers were telling us all the sauces were pre made and there was nothing they could do.  omg. eat here if you want to have high blood pressure This place has changed since it first opened.   Not only is the service bad the food is worse. Waiter did not check up on us hence we did not have fresh napkins or refills. The food was soggy, over cooked, under cooked. The buffet for dinner was not worth $30.00 per person. What made the whole experience worse  was the fact that the waiter never brought  us our check and we waited an additional 10 minutes to pay at the door. Please, save your money and go to the chinese buffet in plymouth meeting mall for only $12 dollars per person. You\\'ll get more of a variety and feel like you had a meal and feel not ripped off. This ihop is okay. Good if you need to have breakfast food in a pinch. My waitress was very nice, but my sides that I ordered took very long to come out (I thought they forgot them), by the time they were done my boyfriend was already done eating and I was full. I thought maybe because my food took so long they\\'d remove an item from the bill ($3 for 2 slices of turkey bacon though?!?!), they didn\\'t, they also charged me twice for an item. My pancakes had something weird going on with them, when I bit into one there was a crunch...not going back. I am unhappy because I cannot get my brownies to go in their plastc wrapper from the instore Starbucks.\\n In the greater scheme of things, an in consequential event but I take them home to the wife and when they get there an hour or 2 later they are still fresh.\\n\\nStarbucks and Target need to fix this.\\n\\nThey come in 2 packs. And I take a two pack. Just walked in to buy a 3$ loaf of bread which I had in my hand to pay for as they put a sign up saying they were closed for an event. They would not sell it even though there were people behind the counter working.  You people lost a good customer. I have absolutely no idea why this place has four stars... and so many reviews. I was so excited when I read the reviews and went in with high expectations only to come out more than disappointed. The food is atrocious. I could barely swallow the rolls I put in my plate... and the sashimi? Beyond horrifying. It tasted old and stinky and I absolutely adore sashimi... I know what raw fish is supposed to taste like. I didn\\'t like one single thing they had out. On top of that, the price is ridiculous! I paid $98 for three people. Is that a joke?? How people can scarf down that food is beyond me. I don\\'t think people understand what FRESH sushi [and food] is supposed to taste like. We took our toddler to breakfast one morning and really wished we had skip this place.  We ve been before and it\\'s an ok place.  People seem to love it but I think it\\'s overrated.\\nOur server was down right rude to my daughter.  Apparently playing with the sugar packets was not acceptable.  She seemed annoyed that I sent back my lipstick coffee mug ( super gross).\\nThe food was average.  I had a $10 bagel sandwich which was not even that good.  My husbands was expensive too and not that good. \\nWe will never be back! Minado is a plain Jane Asian Buffet. \\nIf you\\'re coming from the Philadelphia area go to King Buffet instead. You can get everything there and more for a 3rd the price!\\n\\nI went up to pay my bill and the manager said $32 a person!  I\\'m like \"is that a joke?\" Because I came up to pay for myself and two others. \\nKing Buffet was $15 last time I checked. After taxes. \\n\\nThey said the difference in price was because they have various Sushi. I tried almost all and I can say it\\'s a waste of money. \\n\\nThey should be ashamed. This review is solely for the food (as I have never seen a concert here).\\n\\nI got a burger here in a compromise with friends as a place that offered both beer and food (I was eating, they were drinking. \\n\\nFor $12, got a burger that was small, bland, and dry with a huge portion of fries in an inappropriate proportion compared with the size of the burger. As if they were thinking, the burger is small, so we might as well give a f$&@ ton of fries to compensate. But really, I\\'d rather have not ordered anything in the first place. \\n\\nDisappointing, Johnny Brenda\\'s. Go here for the music, not the food. I am native Philadelphian, lived in many sections of the city and 44 could be a gem, but started to quickly go down hill. My husband and I live walking distance and frequent the shops along 44th street often. I\\'ve been to 44 abour 4 times, with varoius groups of friends the food is never consistant, I can\\'t say I\\'ve  ever had good dish there. Food is burnt,  tasteless or undercooked.  So dark you can\\'t even see your food and waitresses always seem annoyed.  Really dispointing :(. I hope it changes, would love to support the local businesses. Ok environment, order three drinks and waiting for 15 minutes(no customer before me) They do not take credit card. Fresh fruit smoothie is made by fruits and fresh cut. But just takes too long. only one size for drinks and do not have toppings now. I tried milk tea, mango smoothie and mango green tea. I\\'ve been on Spirit of New York before and this experience was nothing like it. First of all - fire your chef. What a disgrace. A 5 year old can cook better than this. Some dry, warmed up pesto pasta, disgusting fish, undercooked, hard broccoli loaded with pepper for some reason. I mean... how can you call yourself a chef? How can you be proud to serve that? Also, if your cruise is having a special type of event, for a certain crowd, please let this be known on the site. Top floor had some R&B loud band and bottom floor was blasting hip hop. SO LOUD that it was impossible to stay there. It\\'s a Saturday brunch, turn it down. This experience was not worth over $80 per person. Will never come back. Long wait, terrible food... fried, small portions, overly salty and just overall poor quality for the $$.  Our poor server was overworked with a huge section and not enough help. We waited 25 minutes, and another 45 to receive food. Our apps came out at the same time as our entrees and they forgot 1 of the children\\'s meals. Never, ever forget the children\\'s meal!  I encouraged him to eat mine until his came out.  The only saving grace was the electronic Android tablets they have for the kids and the gazillion TVs all over the place... but it really can be sensory overload.  I say ease up on the media and boost up your service and most importantly YOUR food!  And if you if \"wings\" are in your restaurant name, they better be the best damn wings ever.  In this case; however, they are not.  I can name 3 other local places that have wings that are 50X better than this place. I made reservations to dine at IndeBlue on Christmas Eve. It was a bit rocky from the start as the host and a server exchanged some terse words before we were even seated. The busy host was trying to make sure tables were cleared and as he requested this to one of the servers he snapped his fingers a few times. As we stood there, the server confronted the host from across the room, \"Did you snap your fingers at me? We don\\'t snap fingers!\" It was off putting and unprofessional. If there was cause for confrontation, it should have been done privately. \\n\\nAfter we were seated we settled in with the crispy spinach chaat and vegetable samosa chaat. They were both delicious. The crispy spinach chaat was the highlight of the meal. One of my daughters ordered the rassam which included cauliflower, baby carrots, french beans and coconut. It was pretty tasty but definitely on the smaller side. The vegetables were prepared well...still carried a crunch and the sauce was well flavored and creamy. My other daughter ordered the paneer tika masala and I ordered the madras with free range chicken breast. These, in my opinion, were average. They didn\\'t blow me away but they tasted fine. I think I was expecting the chicken to be less dry tasting and it tasted how I usually experience chicken in Indian food take out. I am fine when it\\'s your run of the mill take out...but was expecting more from this upscale place. One thing I did appreciate is that I asked for heat with my dish and it arrived bursting with it. Sometimes I find, even if I ask for spicy it comes lacking. This did not. \\n\\nI wanted to order wine with my dinner but once the food runner dropped off our food, we were not checked on until the end. By that time, I had ditched the idea of having wine. Our server was kind, but inattentive. We skipped dessert for the same reason. We were waiting so I finally asked the food runner to speak to our waiter for the check. \\n\\nPerhaps my expectations were too high. I had a very different experience pictured in my head. I probably won\\'t be back. Place was pretty dumpy. The decor is outdated. The air conditioning in the lobby and bar was not working when it was almost 100 degrees outside. I was given a handicap room even though I am not handicapped. Pool was not open 5 out of the 6 days I was there. Fitness room was moved into a conference room due to construction. Very disappointing. They have really let this property go. This is probably the most inconsistent food place in the city of Philadelphia.  I order from here about once a week and finally think it\\'s time  to call it quits.  My favorite Mel\\'s Chicken Cutlet is supposed to be on Sarcone\\'s bread as advertised and the past (2) times I\\'ve ordered it has been on some cheap soggy roll.  Why pay a premium for an average product.  Then they also mess up the order as a whole at times.   Then my biggest complaint comes this week I order Mum Mum\\'s chicken noodle soup and the container is half full, why am I paying $5 for a product that isn\\'t there.\\n\\nThe only reason this isn\\'t getting a one star is because there service is very good and when I complain and others complain someone always tries to fix the problem and does a good job at doing so. Manager seemed like he didn\\'t want to be bothered with my date and I maybe because it was almost closing time. The Brussels sprouts were amazing and my steak was goo. Also there was a huge mouse running back and forth between the tables. The waiter was chasing it away. The manager asked if we wanted to move our seat. They did take 25 off the meal for the rodent problem. Gross. I\\'d love to tell you how wonderful the food was, especially based on the recommendations of several friends. Unfortunately, we never got that far. On a Saturday afternoon at 2pm, two young, perky hostesses informed us that the wait would be 20-30 minutes. We waited 40 minutes without word from the hostesses before inquiring a 2nd time about the wait. \"You\\'re second to the next on the list (whatever that means), probably 20-30 minutes,\" was all we got. No contrition, no pleasantries, nada. So we left -- hungry, disappointed, and a bit miffed at the lack of professionalism displayed by these poorly trained employees. Now it is doubtful whether we would frequent any of the Sabrina locations based on this shoddy experience. A real stinking bummer, dude!!! I used to love Firebird until this past Friday the 16th. My boyfriend and I stopped by for dinner at the bar around 8. We had a couple drinks, ordered seared Ahi tuna salad , coconut shrimp and a 9oz Filet. Everything was ok, but his steak came out Well done instead of Medium, he ate it anyway, because no one ever come out to check on us, and I noticed that our bartender left before we even got our entree, never said good bye or let us know who will take care of us.\\nThe other bartender never checked on us during our entree either, so I couldnt really complain about well done steak. Very disappointed! We left hungry and did not feel like having dessert there anymore. On Friday one of my very best friends got married. We were all staying at Hotel Monaco the entire weekend. After the wedding at the Curtis Center we all decided to continue the party at Stratus. It was 12:50 and they wouldn\\'t let us in. They said they stopped letting people in after 1:00 which is understandable, but we made the cut off. After we showed our clocks they still refused. My best friend the bride has guests that made it upstairs and she was unable to spend time with them. The security guard John Smith was extremely rude to us and unprofessional. Disappointing since we had such a lovely stay at the Hotel Monaco. It puts a bad taste in your mouth. The Yachtsman has been a favorite of ours, ever since it was opened a few years back. Originally managed by the fine folks that brought Philadelphia the now shuttered Emmanuelle, it boasted the finest tiki drinks in all the land. \\n\\nThen, we returned for a visit. \\n\\nThe decor is the same, that\\'s for sure. But we\\'d heard Christian, the original head bartender and menu designer, had gone back down south, so there must be new management in place. \\n\\nWe were pretty disappointed in our visit. No longer the friendly, knowledgeable staff who made quality tiki classics. No longer even the proper rums in stock to make a Zombie or a navy grog (and certainly not the requisite ice cone). And, generally, a lack of the sense of pride in craftsmanship which we used to feel from the bespoke beverages of even early 2016, when the bartenders at least recognized the drinks we asked for when we ordered them-even if they were out of stock.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong-you can still get some of the more familiar tiki favorites here: there\\'s a pina colada and a dark and stormy for everyone, and we came on a night where dark and stormies were $2 off in the rain. The problem is that the menu offerings used to be so much better, and it wasn\\'t so long ago that they were. So, in looking for a fun time, by all means go-but if you need a proper tiki drink, you\\'re best off ordering the Lemon Hart 151 through the liquor store yourself. We order from here all the time but after tonight I\\'m done. We ordered three steaks and an order of American cheese fries. First of all, they took over an hour to get our food to us. Second my fries were burnt to a crisp! I called them immediately and told me that\\'s how they always look!!! Really? And that they were closed for the night and that they closed all the registers and couldn\\'t credit my money back. And to boot, they couldn\\'t bring me a new order. They offered me a credit. I will never order from there again. Keep your credit. I dined here earlier tonight for restaurant week. Unfortunately, Butcher and Singer left me feeling mostly underwhelmed. I ordered the filet. It was under seasoned and came with mashed potatoes which were nothing special. It seemed to me to be a lower quality filet. I\\'m not sure if they did this just for RW or what. The dessert and salad were very good and made up for the poor entrée.  I\\'ve eaten at most of the other steakhouses in Philly and this one is close to the bottom. It wasn\\'t terrible by any stretch but I just had higher expectations. I might have to try this again in the future, but for now I\\'m not running back. Have been here before but not in awhile so here we go. Three burgers all had the same issues. Burgers were dry beef on a crumbling roll. Asked for ketchup and mustard and got so little you could not taste it. Fries were good as I remembered. Place was super clean and the staff was great! Burgers tasted fine but could have been a little\\nMore juicy and the buns fresher. I have been to Coyote Crossing numerous times and have always had a pleasant experience.  The food is great, however it was overshadowed by the horrible service we received.  The waiter was not only careless but extremely inattentive and forgetful.  Numerous times he completely forgot about drink orders and walked away after asking us whether we needed anything else.  He seemed to be in a daze and unwilling to perform any basic duties of a half decent waiter.  If I do go back and he is my waiter I would ask to be moved to a different section or leave. This place is horrible, terrible. Not only is the staff rude and completely absent from servicing, but they will try to rip you off. They claim to tell you that the pasta dishes are NOT the price they\\'re printed and that there\\'s an additional charge, but three separate tables were not made aware of this and subsequently rang up checks hundreds of dollars more than expected. If I could give this place negative stars, I would. I waited two hours for mediocre food, dealt with rude staff, and was charged a lot of money. Never ever again. Went today for lunch. There was 3 separate tables filled when we walked in. We watched as the tables filled, took 30 minutes to receive even a water meanwhile everyone around us received theirs. When it came to food all the couples who came in after us , including big families also were given food before us. Walked out and will not be going back. Got sick from chicken sandwich. They prep cook the chicken and then reheat\\n.Never going back. How difficult is it to cook a chicken breast? This was the worst! All I wanted was hot italian sausage with fried onions and red peppers on a long roll. I clearly stated that after the girl who sounded like she was 10 on the other end made me repeat myself 15 x\\'s before she seemed to even understand what I was asking for. I even confirmed the order before I let her hang up. But what did I get? I got a hard as a rock roll which was burnt to a crisp, smothered in cheese that tasted as unappetizing as it looked when I didn\\'t even ask for it. It went right in the trash where it belonged along with their menu from my kitchen drawer. I spent $12.00 when I should\\'ve just gone to the grocery store instead. I will NEVER order from there again. I hope nobody does either, don\\'t waste your money or your time waiting for their delivery guy to deliver that crap they call food. Maybe this is unfair, but my day did not get off to a good start.\\n\\nOn the way home from center city I decided I\\'d get a pastry and decided to go to Vanilya instead of stopping by the Italian Market. According to Yelp\\'s business page they open at noon today. So I went in a little after 2:30 and found that the dessert case was entirely empty except for one dessert which I didn\\'t want. The woman there (who I assume is the owner) said she got a \"late start today.\"\\n\\nFine, we all get late starts. But it\\'s so so annoying to go into a bakery two and a half hours after opening time only to find there\\'s not a goddamn thing you can purchase. Already this place is open only four days a week.\\n\\nIf you need more time to fill the case, don\\'t open your storefront. If you can\\'t get it done by opening time, maybe the opening time needs to be changed. I purposely avoided going to a place where I know I could have gotten something, just to try Vanilya. Now I\\'m at home, don\\'t want to travel anywhere else, and just won\\'t have anything at all. There\\'s nothing else to get around here besides cannoli. And Belle Cakery is also closed, probably for eternity at this point.\\n\\nAlso, the name \"Vanilya\" is really awful sounding. It reminds me of saying \"Up in ya.\" I am so confused by how this restaurant is rated so high. \\n\\nThe food itself was cooked well, but the sauces were funky. They ruined the meal. Between us we had the Halibut, Hare and a pea soup. The best part was the pea soup. I wouldn\\'t go back here. Called in for an eggplant parm sandwich. The woman that answered  the phone had an attitude.  I don\\'t put up with that. I need to be treated like I\\'m your favorite customer or I\\'ll go elsewhere. You don\\'t have the Italian food market cornered. Don\\'t assume your customer knows the sizes of you sandwiches. Don\\'t assume that you can have people with attitudes answering your phones and that everything will be ok. Your employee cost you a sale. Ridiculously long wait when the park is crowded. Not to be confused with the typical waits at their original store location, this metal ship container turned into an ice cream parlor just takes away from the experience of what franklin fountain really is. You wait uncomfortably close with sweaty strangers finishing their beer while spiders literally weave webs above the line. Maybe if you make friends with those around you the wait isnt as bad. Sometimes I just want mass quantities of some terrible-for-you, Americanized Chinese food smothered in garlicky sweet sauces. \\n\\nGeneral Tso\\'s chicken looked better than it tasted, i.e.: it was huge chunks ...of breading... with the tiniest sliver of chicken inside. The sauce was good, but I would probably not get this again. Sa cha beef was really tasty, I had never seen it before on a menu, so that gets a thumbs up. \\n\\nI ordered via their website (20% off!) and it took over an hour to deliver to my house 10 blocks away. Also, we inadvertently gave the delivery guy a $14 tip. Hope the karma goes back around! ** in response to the managers comment i edit this to document the 23 out of 37 reviewers (over 60%) have less than 5 friends/yelpers as of 12/13/2013.  they may change this after reading the post but i hope yelp investigates.  small business or not - ethical practices and food safety are critical basics.  i was raised with small businesses - not an excuse.\\n\\ni dont understand the 4/5 star reviews.  many of them have lass than 2 friends (many with 0).  shady.  \\n\\nthis is not a traditional sushi restaurant.  fish quality is poor and suspect handling.we ordered chirashi and all got sick from the meal.  the fish (salmon, scallop, yellowtail and tuna) tasted watery - like it was frozen and improperly/quickly defrosted.  the rice ws old and not seasoned like sushi rice.  rather it tasted like day old rice with some sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  we should have known when we walked in and there were large chinese character wall hangings behind the sushi counter.  \\n\\nboth my wife and i suffered the consequences with stomach aches+ (details not provided). Came here because of the overwhelming amount of 4 & 5 star reviews. Man was I disappointed. I can\\'t even say they left a bad taste in my mouth because I never got the food I ordered. I placed our order for a chicken burrito, mahi taco, and pork carnita taco at 7:44. 30 minutes later at 8:15, the first part of our order (Mahi & Carnita Taco) came out COLD as it must have been sitting for awhile.  I asked the server and she said the burrito was on it\\'s way. The tables on either side of us said the same thing happened to them and they were still waiting for portions of their order. I asked the server and she said the burrito was on it\\'s way. 45 minutes later at 8:28 - still no burrito.. and when I went to the counter, they said it would be right up. At this point I was tired of hearing that it was on it\\'s way.. no apologies, nothing. When I asked for a refund of my payment they scoffed.. and said \"it should be right up\". The staff didn\\'t offer anything except for the exact amount for the burrito when I directly asked for it as I was going somewhere else. \\n\\nIf management sees this.. I would like a full refund. I finally decided to try local 44 after passing it many times. I like the decor of the bar. It has that trendy hipster dive bar feel thats real popular these days around the northern liberties area. The food was a huge let down. I had the fish and chips. The chips were go but the fish was terrible. Also the buffalo wings are flavorless and require blue cheese to get any sort of enjoyment out of them. My lady had the general tofu chicken. This was better than my meal but nothing special. Our server seem to have an attitude every time she walk up. Of course when the check came she wants to be all smiles. I do not recommend this place. If you want a good gastro pub as that\\'s what I\\'m told these places are called I recommend going to northern liberties and trying north third. Food was cold and not what I ordered.  Told them of a food allergy to onions and my food had onions all over it.  Nobody was there, and no orders were being made except mine and had to wait over 40 minutes for the food... I had not heard of Korean fried chicken until four days ago, when a local food blog posted a rave review of Meju and their recent entry into the field.\\n\\nThe \"fried chicken\" part had me expecting full-sized, KFC bucket-filling wings, thighs and drumsticks.  Turns out it\\'s much closer to the size we expect from buffalo wing appetizers, which is just fine.\\n\\nGiven a choice of red pepper chili or garlic soy sauce, I went with a small order of the former.  Normally I\\'ll start on the lower end of hotness when trying something new, but I thought I\\'d take a chance this time.  \\n\\nGood choice.  For my own hotness threshold, the red pepper chill sauce has just the right amount of kick.  And there was a lot of kick to be had, as the sauce was thick and plentiful.  I went through three napkins in what almost became a futile effort to remain somewhat clean, plus a fourth at the end to mop up what remained on my hands.  You may want to consider bringing a handi-wipe since none are provided.\\n\\nMy waiter (I didn\\'t catch his name) was very friendly, but flawed in his job.  He spoke so quietly that it was difficult to understand him at times.  He also had a bad knack of not attending to the table for very long stretches of time.  Neither issue is a real deal-breaker, but they were noticeable enough to warrant a mention.\\n\\nOne last thing that\\'s completely unrelated to the restaurant.  To the gentleman sitting at the table across from me:  In the civilized world, people try to cover their mouth when coughing.  Especially if the cough sounds like a lung is about to fly out of their mouth and land on the plate in front of them.  People also chew with their mouth closed.  If I want to hear sounds like that, I\\'ll watch a documentary on farm animals. Had been there a long time ago but forgot what it was like. Got there and was seated immediately (within an hour of closing time). Placed my order but waited 25 minutes for just my salad to come out, let alone entree. I asked the waitress for the wifi code - she didn\\'t know, asked her boss, and couldn\\'t give it to me...Anyway, Salad was bleak. Iceberg lettuce, one tomato, cucumber. On to the entree. I ordered a NY Steak and Chicken. The rice was oily and somewhat over cooked. The meat was average - the biggest thing was that it lacked flavor, aside from the sauce. I also got duped on the vegetables. He gave everyone else more and I got stuck with a pretty small amount. Only a few pieces of broccoli. And it was pretty drenched in teriyaki/oil. \\n\\nUltimately, there\\'s solid entertainment value in terms of how they cook the food (the chef is friendly) however the quality of food and service is poor. The place really does need a face lift. I felt like I was in a 1980s karaoke bar. Stayed at the Ritz and decided to give this place a shot. Ordered the filet - medium.  The steak seemed to be a quality piece but the charred exterior ruined the flavor for me.\\n\\nI would pass on this place and walk a block or two for a better experience. These guys are clearly having some financial troubles... I don\\'t even think there is a chef here any more. Certainly nobody cooking is tasting the food that comes out of the kitchen.\\n\\nEntrées still going for $22 even though the food they serve is clearly well passed the sell by date...\\n\\nThis used to be amazing... Amazing.\\n\\nBut now the food is literally disgusting...\\n\\nGo into Chestnut Hill  or Manayunk unless you feel like paying top dollar for food that is barely edible half the time.\\n\\nWhat a bummer... But the beer selection is pretty good. I like this place the cocktails are great and I can\\'t wait to try the food...the only reason i\\'m giving it three stars instead of five is because of a nasty experience i had with one of the waitresses.....I didn\\'t catch her name but, she has blonde chin length hair..anyway I arrived to meet some friends and I sat down at the table they where sitting at...the waitress quickly came over and said in exacted words \"You can sit here but, don\\'t make this place your own...get it?\"  now i\\'m not sure if it was because i am a person of color or because I am an artist and dress a little different but I make a little over 80 grand a year and can afford to drink in this establishment....I also have great manners and was taught to respect waitstaff but i am utterly mortified that someone in front of my friends and people I don\\'t know,judged me by my appearance and had the audacity to tell me not to make Southwark \"my own\"  I am going back and really hope that I don\\'t have the same experience! Meh. Over-priced and meh. Left hungry and ate a second dinner. Not satisfying. Did I mention over-priced? Ordered delivery for the first time and it was mediocre at best. I asked for jalapeño w/ my yellowtail roll for a little kick, it didn\\'t have any spice. The spicy tuna was very dry. Everything tasted sour. Delivery was quick at about 30 mins. Will probably not order again, a little disappointed. We accidentally entered through the exit, but this shouldn\\'t have been a problem because the place was empty. A man came in the same door after us, but this appeared to be fine with the staff because they knew him. They began to have a conversation while we tried to order. There was one customer waiting for an order. However, we received dirty looks from the two women there, and they were rude to us. I asked about the long hots, but I only got a side of attitude. \\n\\nThe meat on the sandwich was dry, there was minimal cheese (sharp provolone), and the roll didn\\'t taste fresh.\\n\\nThis is the second time I\\'ve been here, and they were out of the \"homemade Italian long hots,\" which are advertised as an option for your sandwich ($1.00). Spinach is the only topping (other than mild or sharp provolone) for the pork. Used to be my spot for cheesesteaks and pizza because they do a half decent job. Then I experienced the worst customer service experience of my life. I ordered delivery one night and they didn\\'t get any part of the order correct. When I called to have the problem corrected they basically laughed and made me drive there to get my money back. They didn\\'t want to re-deliver the correct food or send someone to my house to correct the issue. Will never order from them again. I\\'d avoid this place. 20 health code violations, 2 of which were deemed serious by the inspecting agency. Yikes! I wasn\\'t expecting much honestly, but was upset still. \\n\\nThe service is slow, and our waiter might have said three words to us. The pizza was mediocre, the chicken on it was out of one of those pre-sliced freezer bags and they did nothing to hide that. And what bothers me more than anything is that they didn\\'t mix the sauce with the pasta. That\\'s an instant \"I can\\'t trust you\". We were disappointed with service and the food was over priced.  Our party of 6 had a waitress who was not overworked and very inattentive.  She failed to provide us with silverware and plates for our appetizers.  The appetizer plates remained on the table well after we finished.  She basically disappeared for long periods of time.  The scallop special was over priced for the size of the small scallops.  The other entrees - trout, crab cakes, chicken were good but not great and again for a $$ listed restaurant overpriced.  We would not go back. Went here for the first time last night and was not feeling it at all. For a Saturday night at 10PM, the crowd was lousy. Went to use the restrooms with my girlfriend when we got there and children were throwing poppers into the bathrooms. They were somehow related to the bar as they were going back and forth into the kitchen and were being encouraged by someone in the kitchen. It was really unprofessional on the establishment\\'s part. On our way out, the hosts were encouraging us to come back when the DJ comes, which tells me that they might have a difficult time bringing in crowds. I wouldn\\'t come back here. I ordered the Niçoise salad to go along with a chicken club. \\n\\nThe Niçoise salad is supposed to come with seared tuna. Which is why the price of 18.50 would make sense. \\n\\nWell, ladies and gents. I literally got canned tuna with tuna skin mixed into cheap lettuce and small pieces of potatoes. I was incredibly disappointed when I got my salad. People actually pay this much for this garbage?! \\n\\nThe menu listed on your website clearly states \"seared tuna\" not canned tuna. It looks like a child had put this together. Complete rip off!! Just moved to the area. I like that it right down the street but man, the folks that shop there have their heads so far up everyone else bottoms.\\nMy 1st trip....in 8 months pregnant with a wild 3 yr old son who after 4 hours of fit throwing winter clothes shopping at the mall, I had to scold him by the time we got here. He threw his coat in a puddle because i would let him sit in the Express cart. Some woman flipped out, started twitching and accused me of abusing my son who \"clearly is in great need of something.\" \\nI dont really feel sitting in a cart I\\'ll s a great need.\\nAnother woman chimed in and told me to take parenting class.\\nSo no I did not stop him when we ended up.in line behind them and he proceeded to knock over a stack of kombucha bottles and call one a ugly old buttcheek.\\n2nd trip, i parked in the spot for expectant moms...as again I am 8 months pregnant.\\nThis old guy stands behind my car staring.\\nBy the time I get my purse and get out, he is standing at the front of the doors STARING  me up and down, not moving. \\nBeing 8 months pregnant having a guy scan me like this was freaky and weird so.i threw him a look a d asked if I needed to call the police. \\nHe went to tell me those spots are for pregnant women and I need to move. I get that its 25 degrees out and my crippling baby bump appears non existent underneath my parka but......\\nUm............\\nI think im going to do the drive back to the one in Conshohocken from now on. \\nPeople around here are creeping me out to the point driving into that center makes me feel uneasy.  You can feel yourself being watched like crazy.. and I think it\\'s the snoots of KoP scared Norristown folk are coming over or something, when I never even lived there. If you\\'re desperate and looking for a last minute BYO on a Saturday night in Conshohocken, this is your place. No reservation necessary. \\n\\nOverpriced Mediocre food.\\n\\nOn the plus side, we had an entire room to ourselves with a fireplace on a Saturday night. I had an AWFUL experience. The bearded, white dude with pierced ears really killed my vibe. He was rude to my friend when she asked to use her Starbucks card. Afterwards, he saw me walk back and forth from my seat and the bathrooms to check if they were available, but failed to tell me that I had to use a key. Eventually, a customer was kind enough to share this information with me. I used the key to open the bathroom door and put it back on the counter. I figured that it wasn\\'t very busy there and I was only going to wash my hands for a second, so I didn\\'t need secured privacy. However, when I was about to walk into the bathroom, the guy yells, \"SOMEONE WILL WALK IN BEHIND YOU IF YOU DON\\'T BRING THE KEY IN!\" in the most rude, obnoxious, and condescending tone possible. Later, when he made my drink, it was overflowing all over the cap and it spilled everywhere. I could not even enjoy my blueberry scone or drink because I was SO INFURIATED BY THIS RUDE BARISTA. Ugh, he totally ruined the experience. Went here for happy hour, the drinks were watered down, rum & coke, the waiyer said no wiskey drinks for happy hour, my friend had martini which he said was part of happy hour and we were charged 7.50 per martini anyway, and she said they were watered down.  We had the calamari, eww, and the spinach dip eww we did not eat them, they were awful....guess i should have gone with previous reviews....not good. Sorry...staff seemed nice enough. Review referring to their delivery only:\\n\\nUsually their food is quite delightful but my last experience has made me never want to eat at this location of Sabrina\\'s again. \\n\\nWe ordered delivery , totaling to a 60 dollar purchase with a ten dollar tip. \\nWe didn\\'t receive the correct order or our bacon we OR any utensils !!!!!!!!!! \\n\\nHow am I supposed  to even eat the food without any utensils to begin with ??? \\n\\nAfter spending 70 dollars total on delivery I expect them to at least get my order right and give me the appropriate utensils \\n\\nWe called Sabrina\\'s delivery guy and he said he didn\\'t know call the restaurant \\n\\nWe called the restaurant and the woman on the phone said the manager will call us back in a minute to discuss what happened . THEY NEVER CALLED US BACK!! \\n\\nThis was so annoying and disrespectful. \\n\\nDear Sabrina\\'s , hire some new employees, some that actually are helpful and respectful to their customers. Never again. I will go to the other Sabrina\\'s but the one on powelton is a joke. Thanks for ruining our lunch ;) Asked for gluten free options. Yelp listed this restaurant. When I called they said they had no gluten free options   Shame on Yelp! They just advertise. Just bought a chicken fajita panini from there. Not only was the chicken undercooked, but a panini is supposed to be grilled on both sides. And not only was it not grilled, but it was supposed to come on foccacia or flatbread. They put it on, again non-grilled, regular sandwich bread! Are you kidding me! If I could put zero I would. I have been so many different Dunkin\\' Donuts and this one is awful. I waited in life for 1/2 hour for 6 donuts. If there was a way to back up and leave I would\\'ve but this drive thru is so tight and small. The women that took my husband order was so rude and cut him off every single time he spoke. She said \"I will let you how to order correctly\" EXCUSE ME, if he was ordering it incorrectly the polite thing to do is wait until he is finished and repeat it back the way it\\'s supposed to be said. Horrible customer service and when we got to the window she tossed my husband the donuts... I literally can\\'t make this up, it\\'s insane. I will not be going to this Dunkin again. This place needs a lesson in diversity.  I was traveling alone and since I didn\\'t want to wait was directed to the bar area.  The waiter came over and gave me a funny look when I asked him about a menu item.  He sent BRANDON the manager back who basically told me to move unless I wanted to sit AT the bar.  Since I didn\\'t feel like driving anywhere else, I went back in the line.  I was then seated at a table and it took 5 minutes for anyone to come and ask what I wanted (and even then it wasn\\'t my server).  Justin was the only one who stepped up in this experience and acted intelligently and without the attitude of \"Why are you here?\" I noted that the white family seated after me  got immediate service from my server Bill.  It is a sad thing in 2016 in PA To be treated like Mississippi 1955. \\n\\nBtw: the seafood scatter platter blows.  I don\\'t know if it was me or if they usually serve seafood, fries and coleslaw in a tiny basket and not expect it to be soggy and unappealing.  Save your money boys and girls.  For $14 I\\'ve done better in diners.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Justin was the only good part of the experience. I hardly ever leave reviews on yelp...More of a Google guy...But I felt that I had to share my experience after my recent order today for lunch. First off you would expect $7 for calmari to be somewhat worth it...I ended up with 5-6 overfried pieces of calamari aka just fried coating pretty much. So word of advice don\\'t order the calamari.\\n\\n\\nSecond the actual meal....I got the beef teryaki bento box. Was decently sized.\\n\\n\\nI had gotten the food Delivered. Showed up the soysauce spilled all over everything. So that was a nice surpise to open the bag too.\\n\\nMaybe dine in is better. I would hope so because the delivery was horrible. Mediocre sushi.  Gruff Service.  All you can eat seems like a good idea, but for 25 bucks you can get plenty of higher quality sushi elsewhere and be full.  I\\'ll take quality over quantity any day. This really should\\'ve been named Applebee\\'s.  Clearly a poor cook. Poor mgmt. poor training.  Our waitress didn\\'t know the menu.  Yuck food. I just royally don\\'t get it. The only redeeming quality of the place is fast and friendly service. Bottom line: cookies are good, but pricey and service is atrocious for advance orders or shipments. I have been a Hope\\'s Cookie die-hard for years but in now attempting to work with the customer service, I\\'m apalled at the lack of professionalism - and if you google reviews, it seems I\\'m not the first.\\n\\nThe website was giving me trouble and I called the 888 number for assistance but no one picked up. I called the store and got another phone number to call and the one nice person I spoke to told me that apparently everyone who could assist with the website leaves at 3pm! They said they would have someone call me first thing in the morning at 7am but I didn\\'t get a call until 9am from someone named Jay, who was not only smart with me and wouldn\\'t let me get a word in edgewise, he also wasn\\'t willing to believe that there could possibly be a bug with the website when other orders had come through yesterday. \\n\\nAs someone who works in the technology realm, yes you actually can have an error in particular use cases especially working in different browsers, and you should always offer to look into it or you could be caught saying that the customer is a liar, which is quite bluntly what he essentially said. If the cookies weren\\'t a promised gift for someone who relocated, I wouldn\\'t even bother dealing with these people because there are far better bakeries in Philly. This place is kind of shady. The supervisor has pulled money out of the register and taken two liquor bottles out of the restaurant. The \\'cook\\' is loudly talking about all the black-related shootings and how the whiteys will get theirs.  I\\'m The only one in the restaurant and no one has even come by to refill my coffee for the last 15 minutes. Oh and the bartender put two large shots of jack in someone\\'s coffee for him!!! Super sketch We have gone a few times expecting it to get better .... But sadly it doesn\\'t. Leaving us saying \"why did we come back\"?!?!\\nThe boat looks nice from the outside but once you walk in your no longer amazed. \\nThe bathrooms are gross , \"water\" of some kind on the bottom level bathroom and its dirty and smelly \\nStaff is... Most of them don\\'t seem to thrilled to be there and they are not very attentive to you.... they seem to go mia... from our experience except once. \\nThe lunch tour feels like a school report listening to all the facts of whats on the river as your eating lunch. Very boring....\\nDinner tour is better but for what you pay is not worth it. \\nTo go out on the deck if its not raining is nice to get \"fresh air\" however it gets crowded and let\\'s face it the Delaware view is not the best...\\nThe Dj is ok. And the entertainment just seems to just do what they have to ...\\nIt\\'s sad bc this could be so much better however it seems to just keep going down hill but not the price. I was really excited to try this place out for my fiancé\\'s surprise birthday dinner... but the level of incompetence i\\'ve dealt with in planning this and making sure this day turned out right was ridiculous . I called three weeks prior to make reservations for 10 at 9pm, followed up closer to the date with how far in advance the rest of the party could be seated prior to me and my fiancé showing up. One girl told me oh if at least half the party is there we could start seating, okay cool no problem. Then they call me about a day before the event to follow up on my confirmation and I wanted to confirm what I was told previously , and a manager tells me oh no we need at least 8 people there minus you are your fiancé. Okay I was initially irritated because I was told two different things... and both people I spoke to knew it was a surprise for my fiancé and they told me it would be written in the notes... Well the day comes and most of the party was there minus two people because of traffic, i\\'m on my way with my fiancé and one of the people tells me that a lady at the restaurant told him all 10 people had to be there before anyone could be seated. So now i\\'m furious.... they knew it was a surprise for my fiancé , so what would the point be of having everyone there not seated, and we walk in and ruin the whole point??? I was told they wouldn\\'t budge and said nope all 10 people needed to be there... So i\\'m pissed. I get there and I immediately spoke to a manager and the lady at the front desk... So I was told also before we would get a semi private room... get there and the party before us was still sitting and they couldn\\'t move them, so my whole party had to be cramped in the dining room!!! and not only that the girl said right in front of my fiancé \"oh is this a party for 10??\" like what?!?? why would you do that , when you guys were supposed to have notes stating it was a surprise!!! This entire experience was a nightmare and Ieft a bad taste in my mouth about how this establishment runs its business. Great atmosphere and food, but we were disappointed in the quality of the service. Our waiter never checked in with our table after a large party arrived to bowl that evening. She forgot to put part of our order and we had to track down a floor manager to order more drinks and food. To make matters worse, our waiter never came back to our table until she came to pick up the check and never spoke a word to us. It was the worst experience ever. The sandwiches were not that good at all. The employees were not welcoming, the guy that took our order had an attitude. Actually everyone in there had an attitude. I don\\'t even know why it has 4 stars when I think it only deserves 1 or 2 (not even). I would not recommend this place whatsoever. Visitar el restaurant con 6 personas (incluyendo 1 baby), ordenar para 4 solamente pq uno de ellos es anciano y no desea comer, que te añadan la propina en el ticket pq eran mas de 5 segun la camarera, y q para colmo te procesen la tarjeta y solamente te entregue el recibo a firmar sin enseñarte el recibo de la compra primero, le das propina en el recibo de firmar, y luego cuando exiges tu recibo de compra te percatas de que ya te lo habian cargado y terminas dejando doble propina, y cuando le pides a la camarera cancelar la transaccion te salga con la mentira de que no se puede cancelar. cuando en cualquier sistema de ath o tarjeta de credito SI se puede cancelar cualquier transaccion. Un \\'sorry\\' no me justifica el que me hayas querido ver la cara y quedarte con 13 dolares de propina por un ticket de $40, way too much. muy mala experiencia y mal rato, para colmo no haber un supervisor o manager para manejar la situacion. This location needs to be cleaned up on the exterior. I\\'m actually scared to see what the inside looks like. Surprisingly, the food wasn\\'t bad. I had a large order and the entire order was correct. I wasn\\'t missing items nor was the food cold or nasty. The fries were hot and so was the chicken. The employees also were very courteous making sure that I had everything I needed. I just hope the owner of this location fixes the exterior of the building. Looks pretty bad. You sell Goods to Tanners and it\\'s not their fault but your last batch of scones I got three huge ones. I should have trusted my instinct and no that scones are not huge. I bought them anyway but they were disgusting too much baking soda or baking powder is what made them too big and they tasted like glue whoever baked them should have ditched them and started over. I am not blaming tanners as they are simply a distributor. I am blaming Lochel\\'s because you know better. I placed an order today at 1pm.  It is now 2:30pm and no one knows where my order is.  I could not get through on the phone and when I did I was actually placed on hold for 10 minutes before talking to anyone.  I order from here frequently for lunch but I will be giving it a break for awhile because I felt like my business was no longer necessary or important because you have grown so large. An Italian BYOB that is surprisingly overpriced. The portions are small and the flavors are predictable. The risotto could have been less dry, although the sausage was very good. When the waiter came to take our order, it was obvious that not everyone was ready. He simply ignored those people and took everyone else\\'s order, clearly indicating that the decision making process had a time limit. The restaurant was largely empty, so I am not sure what the rush was about. The bread basket was stale and the tiramisu was good, not great. The food is mostly overcooked and tasteless. I think the mashed potatoes were powdered. I was here on a Saturday night; the singers might have been good, but the sound was amped up so much l went ouside to wait for the rest of my party. All in all, a most unpleasant experience. I have LOVED this place ever since it opened. The food, drink and staff are always amazing. However, I went there after the Eagles parade on Thursday and the whole experience was terrible. I know it was a Thursday but why wouldn\\'t they anticipate the crowds? They had ONE waitress and she was paying particular attention to one table of 6. We sat there for a half hour before we even got menus and she didn\\'t even take our drink order until another 25 minutes. Oh and the only reason she took our order was because I flagged her down. 3/4 of our group got our food and we\\'re waiting for our 4th person to get hers. After taking forever and us shooting daggers out of our eyes at the waitress she said the kitchen \"overlooked that order\". How can it be overlooked when it\\'s the first order taken? Usually always a good time here and I was excited to stop after the parade but sadly disappointed. Unfortunately there was a table behind us with small children and they looked pretty annoyed also. We heard the table across from us complaining to the waitress. It was an unfortunate ending to the awesome day. Went to the Kitchen Bar with my Hubby - stood at the bar for 15 minutes with only 5 people at the bar. Not once did the 2 waitresses acknowledge me or even say, \"we\\'ll be right with you\". \\n\\nThey are prejudice! I WILL NEVER spend my money there. \\n\\n#lostagoodpayingand25%tippingcustomer Stopped in around 1:15 in the afternoon, after the lunch rush. Not crowded at all. I needed to get something to go and figured I\\'d order off the specials menu. I ordered quiche & soup, their lead offerings, assuming that would be the quickest. After a 25 minute wait, the friendly wait staff asked, \"What was your order, again?\" Having been 10 minutes past when I had to be out of there, I politely replied \"a refund\". Disappointing to say the least. We went on a Saturday morning. It was busy but there wasn\\'t a wait. Our server was awful. We ordered and waited, and waited, for our food (which I know isn\\'t our servers fault) but once the food came out it was cold which lead me to believe it sat for a long time which is probably our servers fault. She didn\\'t bring us our juice after we asked numerous times. We both ended up gagging on the pile of coffee grinds at the bottom of our cups. I am definitely more disappointed with the service than the food. I think the food could have been okay if it was warm. Not sure if I would want to try it again...maybe we\\'ll check out the dinner menu. Food was fine but service was a bit slow and we had to cancel some stuff because it wasn\\'t out by the time we were done. One person got the wrong thing. We decided to forgo dessert because we all had work on Monday and couldn\\'t wait for it. Then when the check came and we tried to split the check for the 6 of us we were told we could only split a check into 4. WTF! Why? And why not tell us in advance. We make a reservation on open table 9pm on a Friday night.  We get there and the woman on the intercom tells us they\\'re closed.  She wasn\\'t nice about it either.  No explanation, we\\'re closed, go away.\\n\\nNice. Rarely do I find myself liking something to eat or drink enough to find myself wanting to go back day after day (for the sake of this review all cold pizza situations in the past are not to be acknowledged...) and in a city I\\'ve never before visited, it\\'s rarer still for me to immediately fall for something the way I did for the bar at Amada. \\n\\nGo. Seek. Find. Enjoy. Extremely rude lady tending customers. Hides behind a window and does not hear when you ask about the food she offers. Nothing has labels so it is hard to guess what they are. Worst customers service ever. The lady who took my order don\\'t even paying attention at all. I have to read my card twice. She did not ask me for expiration and three digit number at all. When I receive my order I end up paying cash. I would not call again. Can someone please help the customer. Who understand better English. Highly dispointed. I really really really really did not care for this place. Me and my girlfriend were looking forward to going to Vedge for happy hour but the bar was full (massive womp) so she suggested we give this place a try. My first thought when I walked upstairs to the appropriately decorated tiki bar was, \"this décor looks like its from the dollar store\". It really reminded me of my Wildwood shore house back in the day. But atmosphere aside, the staff was very friendly, the bartender was attentive. However, it wasn\\'t super crowded when we arrived. After about 15 minutes it got super crowded and the vibe was very bro-y. Lot\\'s of guys in polos standing way to close to me at the bar, literally touching me when there was a whole other end of the room pretty open.\\n\\nThe food was a hard \"meh\" with extremely expensive prices for what they were. I got the mushroom bao buns and it was $9. Now I thought for $9 at a tiki bar there will probably be like 3/4 on the plate given that Buddakan charges $15 for a similar but way tastier dish. And then there was only two on the plate!! I thought it was a rip off because it didn\\'t even taste that good. The edamame dumplings were also sub-par. Thankfully they were on special for $3. \\n\\nAll in all, there are way better places in Philly, so I give this place a hard meh. Picked this place for cheesesteak because I was already in Reading Terminal Market. Apparently Obama came here before. \\n\\nGot to the counter, I order a Classic Cheesesteak ($10.50), and the guy asks me if I want sweet or spicy peppers, bacon/pepperoni, and pickles, so I ordered sweet peppers and pickles. Then I decide to not get pickles which was an additional $0.50, and the guy gets annoyed and tells me he can\\'t change it or else he needs to restart the whole order. He then just stands there and waits for me to tell him it\\'s fine don\\'t change it, but I\\'m standing there waiting for him to take the pickles off my order. I only ordered one thing not like he needed to retype in 10 things. Finally he redid my one item order.\\n\\nThe total came out to be about $14 for one sandwich and I was surprised because they charged me extra for the BREAD (?!) and the sweet peppers. First of all, who would order a sandwich without the bread, and shouldn\\'t it be included in the price? Second of all, the menu description of the classic cheesesteak says \"Cheese wiz, mushrooms, onions, pickled hot or sweet peppers\" so the sweet peppers shouldn\\'t have been extra either. \\n\\nFor the actual cheesesteak, there was barely any cheese. If it\\'s a steak sandwich, then yes it\\'s a good steak sandwich. But if you\\'re looking for a \"real\" Philly cheesesteak, this is not the place. Save your money and go elsewhere. Went to Wokano for dim sum on a weekday lunch some months ago.\\n\\nWe tried lots of different dim sum here and it was all pretty disappointing, ranging from acceptable to unpalatable.  The Lo mai gai (sticky rice with chicken & savoury things wrapped in lotus leaf) and Braised chicken feet were a couple of the better ones.  The Steamed meatballs tasted pretty bad, as did the fish balls, which were mostly filler, flavourless, and also had a weird (bad) texture.  For the dumplings we tried, the dumpling skins were rubbery and thick -- when they should be perfectly steamed, thin and delicate.  Other dim sum we tried generally wasn\\'t good, but could be eaten if you\\'re desperate.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve ever appreciated good dim sum, then I don\\'t think you\\'ll find it here. But, if you don\\'t care about the quality of the food (or if you\\'ve never had good dim sum), then maybe Wokano could be an acceptable place to go to for kicks.\\n\\nService was okay.\\nFood... not so much. After 7 years of living in North Wales we finally decided to have brunch at Alice\\'s. It was mediocre at best...the biggest issue being the bakery/restaurants cleanliness. Tables were dirty, window sills sticky and grimy and all we could think about was if the area were patrons are served looks like this what does the prep area look like? Because of our hanger we decided to push through because it was this or starving. The food was decent at best, which is sad because we were really rooting for this local establishment. Additionally, the waitress was not attentive, not even providing spoons to mix sugar into our coffee. Literally had to ask and when she brought us silverware it was just a fork and knife and no spoon. I ended up just getting up and getting my husband a straw from self serve to mix his coffee. What sucked is that we really wanted to try their sweets which their business is built on,but because of the service, the dirtiness of the place and the fact that even their display of sweets looked dirty we opted to skip. Hate to say this because we are big supporters of local businesses, but I would definitely not go to this place again. They really need to clean it up and consider altering their pricing structure for the type of service and food that you get. I have been here quite a few times. This visit is my last. Had dinner here last night with a group of 8.  We arrived at 7:25 and our entrees came at 9:00.  We had ordered 2 salads and 1 appetizer.  We had to remind them we were waiting for an order or mussels since they brought the salads first and about 20 minutes has passed. The service here is AWFUL.. Our waitress hardly came to the table.  We had to ask about 5 times for them to refill our water, and 3 times for more bread.  Unacceptable.  The food is very good but who needs a waitress that is pouting and inattentive?? She was completely oblivious.  Then the owner (I think) came to the table to schmooze and tell us jokes, completely ignoring the fact that our waitress was terrible, which I\\'m sure she knew.  NEVER AGAIN. Ridiculous to run a restaurant so under staffed. Get more wait staff or have the servers or SOMEONE apologize for the worst service I have ever had in a restaurant. Don\\'t know how this place stays in business. This was the worst place to get anything really. The best thing was the orange juice. The chicken and steak tacos were as flavorless as the menu options. Please do better. Too slow. I have been here for 10 minutes and no one has taken my order. There are some people here but it is not busy. Hoping for better. Talked to the owner will give them another chance. This time I left without trying the food. Especially at lunchtime most people need to get a quick bite and be on their way. This issue is more related to the waitress then anything else. When I have a coupon to use, it tells me you need to show it before ordering. Non sense on this check out process. Will not come back any time soon Are you serious? The atmosphere is nice, but the food was horrible! Our food came out cold and tasteless.  Definitely will not go back to this pretentiously Americanized place! We ate here for my birthday in early December and it was one the worst dining experiences of my life. The food was decent and the waitstaff was fine. It was the owner that ruined the experience! He told us we were being too loud and that we had to leave. My friends had just finished singing happy birthday to me and we were all having a great time drinking and eating at that point until that clown came up to us and told us to leave! Never been treated that way! The first time the owner came over to tell me we had to leave was because another large party was coming in which we found out was a lie. Then, when my friend tried showing him bad reviews on her phone of his restaurant and of him personally, he shoved her! He actually said to her \"get out of my personal space\". My sister even overheard one of the waiters say that the owner was the reason he was quitting!  The owner then proceeded to tell us that we had to pay in cash because the machine was broken! It said on their website that it took credit cards so bascially another lie by that man! Unbelievable experience at a restaurant that I will not be going back to ever! The owner is a liar and he does not like having big parties at his restaurant. Guess he doens\\'t like returning customers because my friends and I will never go back there again! Friday night. Full staff. 3 tables occupied. Cannot get a waiter or waitress to take our order to save our lives. Apparently, huddling over each other\\'s cell phone takes precedence. Maybe the service is why it was empty. Nice job manager. I\\'ll take my $200 elsewhere. Yelp said open till 2am. Made res for 930. Showed up, door locked. Wouldn\\'t let me in. This place is trash. An employee informed me that the owner of the cafe lives in the back room of the establishment and lets employees sleep on the couch in the dining area. He also has a dog which I\\'m assuming lives in the cafe as well. This information alone wouldnt be terrible if the food was decent or the service was mediocre, but unfortunately, it wasn\\'t even that. I left utterly dissatisfied, the menu is terribly overpriced and the establishment is disorganized,  unsanitary,  and delivers terrible service. I\\'ve never given this negative of a review before but this cafe deserves nothing better. This restaurant certainly has a challenge ahead of itself and that the last two places that were there did not do well. My wife and I went in to check it out as we are fans of Mediterranean food and also ate at Desert Rose. There\\'s a significant contrast between the two. We thought the prices were a little high but somewhat expected it; however, when the food came out it was hardly enough to share. The server had the chef and owner come over to speak with us and, when justifying why the cost was so much higher and the portions are so much smaller, he also proceeded to tell us how much the lease was in media ($2k) versus the new place ($30k). I\\'m not sure if he ever watches the profit or restaurant impossible, etc. but you never pass on any of that information to your patrons. Quite frankly, it\\'s not our responsibility to pay your increase in lease. After his smug remarks our server came over and we asked for a check and left. It\\'s going to take a lot for me to ever consider going back there and also to go to Desert Rose again. Hey Philly, what\\'s up? Not much, just cheese steaks. Meh, they are okay here but the customer service was so bad that I wouldnt consider going back. They also wouldn\\'t let me get a cup of water. Bottle or nothing. Who does that?!? Echoing previous comments the portion sizes are large, service is fast and a very reasonable price.   The pasta was very good,  and so were the sauces salad and bread; however,  the chicken we had as the meat was less than good.   Overall,  the chicken was over dried and It\\'s clear it had been sitting on a Baine Marie for a long period of time and also cold,  so likely out of temperature.  Fast food but not something I can or will recommend. The noodles here are always over cooked, soggy and mushy! The Dan Dan Noodles yuk! Staff not very friendly or accommodating. Not my favorite spot to go to. I was so excited to visit Philly for the first time and try an authentic cheesesteak. There are so many reviews on this place.....and I was so disappointed. Maybe I caught them on a bad day, but this place was not worth the hype. Apparently, you can only order the sandwiches as they have listed on the menu, because they put so much meat in them and there is no room for extra toppings. The bread was also really hard and tasted old which really ruined the cheesesteak for me. So basically, they couldn\\'t prepare me the cheesesteak that I wanted to buy, and they also couldn\\'t sell me a well prepared cheesesteak either. Very disappointing for a first timer! Disgusting , to be clear THIS IS NOT AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD , just unauthentic tasteless food you\\'d expect from shitty applebees and tgi fridays. Not to mention how loud it is with the 20 tvs blaring and some ass walking around with a bullhorn shouting trivia questions in your face. If you\\'re a mental patient, and like eating from a trough then this is your place. Food was not good. The burger made me sick and the fries were cold. They definitely need to step up their game. We did ask for no onions on one of the burgers and that was correct. Mm. I don\\'t know what was the big deal about this place. It was nothing special in terms of food. First the restaurant was filled with generic tables. I think IHOP would look so much better. Mind you... I love restaurants with old, simply look that makes you feel like either you are away from home, or you are transported to somewhere interesting. I traveled this far to eat this generic breakfast...not a fan. I don\\'t mind paying if the food is good. I got the \\nCarna Asada iron skillet. The steak was okay but the pick de gallo was fried and not very Good. The beans and rice that came with it really had no flavor. My wife got fish tacos and there was no flavor at all. Besides drinks and chips/salsa/quac your paying for atmosphere. I would not go back. I\\'ve had much better Tex mex in the city My company orders from the Wayne Domino\\'s for lunches for student groups at a local high school.  We have been doing this for many years.  Today at 10:00 we were informed that they could not deliver the order, that they had previously confirmed, at 10:30.  Did I tell you that we ordered 24-hours in advance?  There was no apology, no explanation - just we have too many orders and we can\\'t fill yours.  So thankful that an independent Pizzeria jumped in without hesitation to assist.  And they weren\\'t even open yet!  Domino\\'s - you are the worst.  And I was hoping for Zero Stars but I had to give at least one to complete this!!!  AWFUL! This is my friends\\' favorite bar, and I love little local pubs, so I was really excited.  When we got there, it was packed, so we sat in the back.  The food and beer was good, although a little over-priced.  While I was eating, two dogs kept coming up and begging for food, which I found really annoying, especially considering I am allergic to dogs.  All of a sudden, one of the dog has diarrhea all over the floor.  It took the owner 10 minutes to clean it up.  He never apologized or offered any of the 10 patrons in that room a free beer or refund.   He also did not clean up the smell.  When I went to complain and said it still smelled, he just shrugged his shoulder and said, \"the dog doesn\\'t usually do this.\"  The stench was so bad we had to leave.  I didn\\'t even half finish my meal because of the smell and I got no refund.  Talk about a health code violation.  If you want your dogs in a bar, they need to be well trained.  It is NOT OK to have them beg for food that you are buying from their owner and certainly not OK to ruin people\\'s meals by defecating on the floor.  This bar is a health code violation waiting to happen.... This was so disappointing. My reservation was for one person at 7:45pm. Arrived three minutes early and was told they were waiting on some tables and it would be a few minutes. I was welcome to proceed to the bar or wait by host stand, which had no room. I circled the bar many times to get attention of a bartender, so crowded I couldn\\'t get near the bar and one end was roped off for servers only. Really took 15 minutes to get a glass of house Cab for $16. After 30 minutes of walking around I gave up and left. After 50 minutes after my reservations I got a call to let me know my table was ready. I said really 50 mins. To which the hostess replied well we just didn\\'t have a table. I searched open table and it said there were still tables available every 15 minutes. Rude and unprofessional and unorganized. Don\\'t waste your time. Don\\'t waste your money. We almost skipped this place because of the rude lady taking our reservation on the phone.  She sounded like the bitchy cheerleader that says \"you\\'re welcome\" from the show Awkward.  \\n \\nWe made a reservation for 8 pm, and arrived about 15 minutes early.  They took us in promptly.  \\n\\nWaiter service started out strong, with a young guy who explained how everything worked.  He said the wait staff worked together to serve your meal...  And at some point it appeared they stopped working together because our plates were either unexpectedly removed while there was still food or left uncollected while we waited for someone to come with the check.\\n\\nThis place could feed homeless people everywhere on the food they threw away.  Half eaten side dishes that you plate yourself were discarded and fresh brought to the table...  UH, I wasn\\'t done with that!  \\n\\nI\\'d recommend the grilled bananas as soon as they hit the table...  Little crispy, caramelized bits on the end and gooey inside.  Omg, I risked my banana allergy for them...  \\n\\nThe meat was fabulous...  But the salad bar was phenomenal.  Everything on that bar was good, even stuff my husband usually refuses to eat. The brisket is decent and the portions are  generous. The sweet potato pie is bland and a waste of money. Two stars are because the delivery is so hit or miss. I\\'ve ordered from here 4 times, and twice I got a call over 30 minutes after order to be told I\\'d need to pick up or cancel because they don\\'t have a driver. The 2 times they did manage to deliver, it was 90+ minutes, and the room was room temperature. They need to figure out consistent, fast delivery, or stop altogether. 周末人特别多 尤其是卖donuts的那家 能绕一大圈 不过真的物美价廉 不到6刀可以买到6个不同口味的donuts 巧克力的不是很甜 然而像海盐焦糖 花生酱等有填充的口味都非常甜 虽然吃上去第一口味道很惊艳 面皮非常松软 一口咬下去 大块的奶油爆出来 幸福感超强 但确实太甜了 吃一个就够了 建议平常时间去 不用排队 可以选择最喜爱的口味\\n这个集市非常大 从卖烘焙用品到新鲜水果蔬菜再到小餐厅 五脏俱全 是购物的好选择 离chinatown也很近 步行就能到 Any time I try a new Italian restaurant I order the spaghetti and meatballs. I figure if you can\\'t get that right there is no point in dinning there again. To start I ordered the pancetta wrapped shrimp with a horseradish sauce. While the flavor combination was great the shrimp and pancetta were over cooked and chewy.  For the main course I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and was disappointed from the start because instead of spaghetti it was linguini and I don\\'t like linguini. Full disclosure I have some strict and strange guidelines about the types of pasta I will eat. While I wasn\\'t happy about the linguini I gave it a try anyway and the sauce was excellent. As for the meatballs they were good, but inconsistent; two of the three were salty. As for the service everyone was friendly, outgoing, and attentive. It\\'s a real team effort to make a great dinning experience happen and on this particular night the cooking staff failed. How is this place still open? The wait staff is the most incompetent that I have ever encountered. The service is consistently bad, and the food is mediocre at best. Why can\\'t our neighborhood have a decent coffee shop? This place seems to be one of the few choices in the area. It is the location that QVC and Zoetis house their employees coming from out of town. They advertise this weekly comp cocktail hour like if happens everyday, but don\\'t be fooled it\\'s only on Tuesdays. Starwood properties have Starbucks coffee in room which is a plus. Their restaurant is NOT good. Go across the driveway to potentially the worst outback in America, it\\'s better than the restaurant here. The rooms need a remodel as there are some minor touches that are dated. Walls are thin so I always come here equipped with ear plugs and sleeping mask. To be honest, have not stayed up the street at holiday or hampton inn...but if you have a choice they might be worth a shot because nothing special is going on here. Three stars for the on sight bar which I would guess holiday inn and hampton don\\'t have. Came here with a friend. I ordered a Hoegarden on tap..it was as flat as my friend\\'s ass. \\n\\nHe ordered a Yuengling..that was warm and flat. A corona would have been better than what he was served. \\n\\nWhat the heck? Only reason they are getting two stars is cause I believe in minimum of 1 star and the cute bouncer gave it another star. So we just had lunch with my family at Iron Hill Brewery in Chestnut Hill. We ordered food and everyone\\'s food came out but mine. I waited and waited. Still no food. Meanwhile the waitress never came out to check on us so she had no clue that my food hadn\\'t arrived. Then she finally comes to the table after everyone at the table is half way through their meals and asks \"is everything ok?\" I immediately said \"No, I have no food\". She says \"oh s%#* and walks away\". She comes back with a well done burger and cold fries. I ate the burger because I was hungry but I made sure to let her know when she returned to the table. I know it wasn\\'t her fault that my food didn\\'t arrive but if she was more attentive and checked back in with us she would have known this. After we left the restaurant we saw her in the parking lot sitting on the ground talking on her cell phone. My hubby talked me out of going back into the restaurant to give them a piece of my mind. They are hit or miss.  In the few times we got delivery, it took about an hour.  A good variety of pizza and tastes good overall.  Actually like it better re-heated the next day as opposed to directly following delivery.  \\n\\nSandwiches have been soggy each time and the bread has been texturally off.  \\n\\nToo many places to order from to wait an hour for delivery. Inside of cafe is so messy, not clean at all,,\\nMy coffee, americano,, tasted horrible. Which is hard to make it terrible ,, it is just black coffee after all. \\nAnd my partner ordered caramel macchiato,, it was not any better. Horrible as well. \\nWaste of money on coffee I was really underwhelmed by this restaurant. I made a Sunday brunch reservation for my boyfriend and me at the recommendation of a coworker. The staff was late in seating us and gave us a tiny table that couldn\\'t fit our big menus. The food was decent, but my Eggs Benedict were way overdone, with the yolk being completely hard. Definitely overpriced and overhyped. I went here recently for brunch with a group of my friends. Please save your money. No one in our group of six liked their meal. The food was barely heated. Portions were small. Meats were really unimpressive. Staff and decor was nice though. The service was embarrassing.  The server was rude, encouraged us to order too much, and was non existent during the meal.  The food was average at best and overpriced.  Atmosphere was OK.  Would not return or recommend. I highly recommend you avoid this restaurant if you want to have a pleasant experience devoid of political controversy. Came in to eat tonight, and a gentleman having dinner politely asked one of the manager\\'s to turn off or change the channel of a television playing a political program that our president happened to in. Rather than understand that many people in this country would like to eat without politics intruding upon their meal, this manager decided to insult the customer and tell him he was being disrespectful. Kathleen, the waitress who was taking care of me and my family, discretely apologized to the gentleman who had asked to have the channel changed for his experience. I have now learned that she was fired for this. Not only will I nor my family be returning to Pietro\\'s, but I will be informing everyone I know about the unprofessional behavior shown by who they choose to employ as management. Food was great, terrible management (I believe the manager in question identified herself as LeAnn). Politics and religion have no place in a restaurant Bagel was so burnt it was not edible and order was incorrect. Come on, how do you mess up a garlic bagel with butter! Have you ever heard a restaurant that wasn\\'t willing to sell you more food?  Well if you go to this place expect it!  I wasn\\'t asking for free food - I was willing to pay.  Apparently math not their strong suit.  \\n\\nAnd the food.  Meat soaked in sauce.  Can\\'t recommend this place! I have no idea how this place got good ratings.  The pizza crust was like cardboard & the cheese was a mess. Waste of money. Never again\\n\\nUPDATED: however, it was excellent 2nd day pizza! If I order again, I\\'ll wait to the next day to eat it There\\'s no cheese in their croque madame. Why??\\n\\nThe food could be better for the price. Otherwise, the atmosphere at the place is great. The Price. I heeded Yelp\\'s advice and went at lunch time when the meats were the same but the price was substantially lower.  What I conveniently ignored however was the fact that the restaurant is \"not good for children.\"  I mean 2 adults and 2 kids that eat like adults at an upscale meat buffet for 80ish bucks?  One kid (under 5) eats for free?  Hah? I\\'m in.   \\n\\nThe service. It\\'s impeccable.  I would say though if you\\'re looking for quiet conversation then head elsewhere because it borders on over attentive here.  Towards the end of our lunch the damn card was red and the gauchos still kept bringing out food.  I tried to decline one guy and he said \"But you request.\"...he made me eat the meat.  I began hiding bits of food on my plate like a scared child.  Who does that? *raises hand*\\n\\nThe food. The stars for me were the chicken legs, the ribs, and the picanha.  The fillet Mignon was meh.  The rib eye, alcatra, and frildanha were also tasty.  Couldn\\'t bring myself to eat Mary\\'s little lamb so no comment on that.The cheese bread was gross IMO.  In fact their entire lineup of sides could use an overhaul.  I wasn\\'t there for that though so I\\'m not deducting stars based upon that observation.\\n\\nThe tips.  Visit at lunch and save money.  Drink tap water instead of the overpriced bottled water and tiny bottled sodas.   Don\\'t load your plate up with a bunch of stuff at a time.  Otherwise you\\'ll end up loving something but not be able to identify what it is.  Go hungry! Oh, and your kids WILL embarrass you. Unsatisfying meal. The cooking for each dish was just a little off. The pizza was too tough. The fried okra tempura was too heavily friend. The seared tuna was underdone and chewy. The ambiance was very cool though. If there was a ZERO star rating, this place deserves it!! The service is absolutely awful and the server was very rude. Besides telling us to sit where ever we want (the place was completely empty, that should have been a clue). We were served only warm tap water with ice, not the traditional tea. When I asked if they had cooked sushi, he said in a bitchy tone \"you can\\'t come to a sushi restaurant and expect to find cooked sushi\" and walked off. Not even trying to understand what I was wanting or other options they may have. After 5 minutes he comes back and tells me to flip the page and there is cooked and raw rolls. Why couldn\\'t he have done this before. He disappears again for 5 minutes. We order our rolls and wait for 20 minutes before our order arrives. He doesn\\'t return to check on us, check to see if we like our food, if we needed anything or nothing. He just sat in the back of the restaurant eating his lunch. When I got his attention I asked him what kind of fried wontons they had. He said...\"pork\". We asked if they had chicken and he replied \"We only eat pork wontons, never chicken\". Again very rudely! During the meal, I had finished my water, he didn\\'t even check to see if I wanted more. I flagged him down to ask for more water. By this time, I didn\\'t want it anymore, but I just wanted him to do it.  I couldn\\'t wait to get out of there. Got the bill and didn\\'t even wait for him to come back, I went directly to the counter to pay. It hurt me to pay $45 for a meal I didn\\'t enjoy and awful service. \\nI will never return to this place! Not just for the terrible & rude service but also for the less than ordinary food. \\nSAVE YOURSELF (AND YOUR $$)  & STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!! I don\\'t like to give bad reviews but this place just isn\\'t very good. The service is great and the people there are very friendly (which I believe is the real reason Three Brothers receives such great reviews.) \\n\\nI have eaten here a few times and was never very impressed but my meal this past weekend was especially disappointing. I don\\'t know how a place can claim to be \"authentic Mexican food\" when they serve that processed \"nacho cheese\" you can buy from stores that probably isn\\'t actually cheese. I got nachos and they were coated in the stuff as well as some bland, soupy guacamole that I also suspect was some processed store product. The actual chips were heavily salted and tasted slightly stale. Just not very good at all, overall.\\n\\nNothing here seems very fresh or authentic to me. There are better options in the area if you\\'re looking for authentic mexican food.. Three Brothers is fine if you\\'re looking for something quick and cheap. Was not a fan. The waiter was good until the end. Host stand and the lady that seated us weren\\'t very welcoming. I ordered the Cajun chicken penne and my boyfriend ordered the bourbon chicken. My pasta was all oil. It was basically soup to the point I couldn\\'t eat much of it so I tried he bourbon chicken from my bfs plate and it was just dry chicken covered in sauce. Not very good at all. I decided to take my pasta home in a Togo container and when I was tilting the plate to let the oil drain to the other side and scoop the pasta into my container the waiter grabbed the plate out of my hand and was like let me help you. It didn\\'t help. I managed to spill pasta on then table and he was tilting the whole plate towards my container letting me take the oil home with me so at that point I took the plate back and said I got it. I had to seriously insist on doing it myself cause he was so determined to do it for me. The oily pasta upset my stomach and now I\\'m trying to give it a try for lunch to not let the food go to waste but I can\\'t. There\\'s no fixing it. I won\\'t be back This place is terrible. I ordered the steak medium rare, and it came out over cooked. It was really chewy and hard to eat. It was way over priced. I have had better steak at Long Horn. The fried lobster was really chewy, and it didn\\'t taste very good. The batter made it taste overly sweet. The lobster Mac and cheese literally only had one small piece of lobster in it! Even though I came here on a Friday, this place was quiet and almost empty. The atmosphere was just dead. The service was bad as well. The food took a long time to come. I had to ask for the check two times, and it took more than 20 minutes to come despite the fact that this restaurant was empty! I\\'ve been here before over a year ago, and it wasn\\'t too bad then. There was more people then too. I won\\'t be back after this visit. I work at a bar a block away and am always looking to support my neighboring businesses.  So last week I went in and ordered the eggplant rotellini appetizer special and the gnocchi entree to go. The total came to $32, which seemed very high, but if it was good, it would be worth it. Well, it was not.  There was only one small rotellini, which was caked with batter and dry ricotta. It was very disappointing. Then the gnocchi.  There was again a very small portion and it was smother in so much grated parmesian cheese that it was salty to the point of being inedible.  The sauce was OK, but salty as well.  There was a big chuck of Italian bread with it, but no butter, so super-dry. The gnocchi was $16, btw, which is a lot for plain gnocchi and sauce with no meat, etc.  I returned it and was offered to have it remade, but I wasn\\'t happy with the first so I refused a second.  Plus I had no time as I had to start my shift.  I was offered no refund or raincheck.  I won\\'t go back. The cheese steak with provolone, onions, sweet peppers, and mushrooms was bland. The meat was flavorless, and the toppings all tasted the same (pickled). I also felt that it needed now cheese to balance out the large amount of meat. It was edible, though, and satisfied my hunger. Crowded on a late Sunday afternoon which is the sign of a good restaurant.\\n\\nThe salmon burger was, sadly, nothing spectacular. The salmon was a bit overcooked and lacked seasoning that could\\'ve made the natural flavor of the burger sing. In addition, the bread-to-salmon radio was a tad too high especially considering the dry wheat bun. While the burger was passable, the sweet potato fries were a disaster. They were limp and soggy owing to the fact that they were cut like regular fries. But sweet potatoes don\\'t hold up like regular potatoes.\\n\\nMaybe I\\'ll come back after restaurant week for another try. Palermos was once my favorite pizza shop; behind Maple Glen\\'s Pizza, but not anymore.\\n  They\\'re starting to use cheap quality cheese thus resulting in a too oily pizza. The crust isn\\'t the same either. Sometimes my pizza crust is burnt!  Their pizza is now too salty and they just don\\'t have that kick of flavor anymore! \\n I\\'m so disappointed! We went to a Flyers game for my birthday and ate dinner at the Cadillac Grille beforehand. We had a reservation for right when it opened so we were seated right by the glass which was cool, and the restaurant for the most part was actually pretty empty until right before the game. There wasn\\'t a whole lot of options for the food - and I was pregnant at the time so the number of things I could eat off the menu was no more than about 4 things.  We started with the brisket empanadas which were really tasty.  Listen - before I go on - you must understand I \"get\" that you are paying for dinner to eat in the Wells Fargo Center and just like the inflated prices you pay around the arena, these will be as well.  But - we paid $15.00 for the brisket empanadas.  And there were only TWO empanadas about 3.5 inches long.  That\\'s it.  That rip off was a little excessive we thought.  I had the burger, nothing to write home about for a $20 burger, and my husband ordered the scallops.  Again, his entrée was $38 and there was 4 scallops on his plate.  I felt bad and gave him half of my meal because I didn\\'t want him to be hungry.  We also ordered a side of the mac-n-cheese, which was cold throughout.  All in all - the atmosphere was cool, but this was definitely a once and done type thing - to say - yeah we ate there, but we won\\'t ever go back.  Especially to have a bill of $150 when one of us ate a hamburger. And as my husband stated afterwards ... \"I kinda wish we just would have went to Lorenzo\\'s\". I heard a lot of buzz about this buffet so I decided to try it for lunch one Sunday ($18 per person). What a disappointment! The sashimi was not fresh and there wasn\\'t a lot of variety. There were plenty of cold dishes and hot dishes (which were basically chinese food), but I guess I was looking for good sushi. Did not find it here...\\n\\nFor the high price, it was definitely not worth it. It\\'s so over-rated. Oh lawd!  I just ate the most horrifc lunch at E & C.  A meatloaf sandwich - wherein the meatloaf contained multiple bone fragments.\\n\\nSooooooo disgusting,\\n\\nFortunately they took it off the bill.\\n\\nI used to tolerate E & C - I will now NEVER go back on my own accord.  (Alas, some co-workers insist on dragging me here.)\\n\\nBLECH! Worst burger and grilled cheese I\\'ve ever had. Service was weird as well. I was there with a black friend and we got strange looks from all that worked there. I have eaten here a few times when I\\'m on Penn campus. The food seems to lose flavors over time. I usually get the Korean beef tacos with Thai iced tea. For the most part, the food was legit, even though the meat is very little. One of the things I love about tacos is that, you have a lot of food packed between a small tortilla, so you get such big flavor in a small bite. Tyson Bees double stacked their tortilla and gave very little meat so you ended up tasting more flour than protein.\\n\\nWith that said however,  Tyson Bees is still a staple at UPenn and I will probably continue to buy food from here. The reason why I had to give a lower star is because of the last time I was here. I ordered Thai iced tea and for some reason, it was so bad that day. The tea tasted like left over tea someone drank and the ice melted out. I couldn\\'t finish it, it was bland. If you\\'re looking to try something new and you\\'re in the area, stop by, I don\\'t recommend driving all the way here though. There\\'s much better options throughout the city. You have to go through the grocery store to get to the restaurant. A sham! Seriously dissatisfied. The flavors were all on the surface of the foods and lacked complexity despite the abundance of ingredients.  I could de-bone some chicken wings and pour hoisin sauce on them myself!! The only reason i gave it two stars is because of the cheese rolls and the yucca fries. This place wont last. The best thing about the night was the wine and a friendly server (who happened to go to college with one of my friends). Im still trying to figure out the Peruvian part? This certainly isn\\'t a place one would go back to. Sorry D! Ill pick better next time. Think of this as a WAY WAY WAY overpriced Wawa! I\\'ve been to the Fogo de Chao in Washington D.C., and this restaurant in Philly did not hold up in comparison. We got the same three meats brought to our table repeatedly rather than the variety I was used to. It was only when we asked for specific meats that they came to our table. Also, we ordered the creme brulee after the meal. I had it in D.C., and it was outstanding. This one tasted like it had been sitting out for 15-20 minutes before being brought to us which makes sense because we waited a LONG time after ordering dessert before it came to us. It took another 10 minutes to get a waiter who then brought the manager. The manager brought a new creme brulee free of charge which we appreciated. However, at the end of the dessert, it took another 15 minutes to get the waiter to bring our check, and when we told her we had not received the check, she acted dumbfounded. We were at the restaurant almost two hours which is ridiculous considering the serving style. Overall, the salad bar, sides, and meats that were brought to the table were good. However, I was unimpressed with the waitstaff and dessert. In general, not worth the price. The food taste better cold, I got the jerk chicken and it wasn\\'t spicy at all. The rice and beans taste very sweet which threw me off completely. The goat was good but I prefer the Jerk Hut better Had to wait an hour and half. Seated where it\\'s apparently their \"waiting area\". Felt totally claustrophobic. People were standing just about on top of us, if their hair was to fall out it would land in our food! Food was just ok, but the waitress we had was very nice. Don\\'t think we\\'d go back. I\\'ve never written a yelp review, let alone a bad one, but the service here is horrible. I had a bad experience months ago and was appalled by the behavior of the servers but I ignored it. I went back about 5 months later (tonight) and experienced the same thing. The first time I went, they kicked us out immediately after we bought our slices even though we all tipped them and were extremely pleasant and nice. We put our pizza on an empty table and the guy flipped out saying they were closed and we had to get out immediately. If that were the case, there was a MUCH nicer way to go about it. Tonight I went in and ordered two slices and was rudely acknowledged by the counter person. I understand it\\'s late on a Saturday night, but I work in the service industry too. I don\\'t care how tired you are, you don\\'t disrespect customers like that. I was so appalled I canceled my order. I don\\'t know who was working on 3/30/14 but they need a lesson in customer service because their behavior was atrocious. If I behaved like that at my job, I would have been fired on the spot. Disgusting. I\\'ll never return and I\\'ll make sure to tell everyone I know not to go to Soho Pizza because the service was horrifying.\\n\\nOn a positive note the pizza is great. But the servers are so rude it\\'s not worth it. No. \\n\\nGiven the good reviews, I was really disappointed. The servers were nice, but the food just wasn\\'t good, and I\\'m not that much of a sushi snob--I usually LOVE sushi if it\\'s even in the ballpark. This was not in the ballpark. \\n\\nStrike one: tamago was dry and completely flavorless, as if it had been refrozen multiple times. \\n\\nStrike two: I asked for a roll with no mayo. It came with a lot of mayo. I mentioned this to the server and she said, \"oh yeah--But is that okay?\" I said that I didn\\'t really like mayo. I ended up eating it anyway because I didn\\'t want to annoy the chef. \\n\\nStrike three: the salmon in the roll was neither generously sliced, nor particularly fresh. \\n\\nBonus strikes: tea was odd and they were out of the dessert I ordered, though it was still on the menu. \\n\\nI ordered take-out from Kansai a few days earlier and it was terrific, though, so you CAN get great sushi at this price point in Philadelphia... just not here. I\\'ve been to U-Town twice (and Koreana, their most direct competition, about five times) and I honestly can\\'t say that much good about them when my experience with Koreana has consistently been better. I got the budaejigae (#36?) on the menu and it was kind of meh and also had a weird soapy taste to it (not sure if it was that or the rice that came with it) as if the dishsoap hadn\\'t completely been washed off the dishes before they served the food. I got one of the soon doo boos the first time I went (don\\'t remember which one) and it wasn\\'t particularly memorable. Double disappointment. \\n\\nShe was very excited to try this place, especially the truffle cheese thing, however this thing was overloaded and overwhelming in the amount of truffle. She was sad. \\n\\nI went along and got the grilled chee with brisket. That lil brisket was equally disappointing and the wich was a greasy mess. Cost too much and took too long for me not to be disappointed. \\n\\nThis place is probably not making my Terminal Top 20. A poor selection of decent wines, and overpriced to boot. Sadly, this isn\\'t the only PLC store that\\'s run like a low-end convenience store. I know there are larger and better stocked stores nearby, but why is this one so not like that? Although convenient on my way home, this place has one of the WORST selections of whiskey/bourbon I have ever seen at a liquor store.  Why even open a liquor store if you aren\\'t going to have quality bourbon?  This is America after all. I call Han at 9:22pm and ask for take out. I\\'m told kitchen is closed. I ask what time do you close since site says 10pm (I ask because this is the third time I\\'ve call before 9:30 and told they\\'re closed) and I\\'m told kitchen closes at 9:30 and the dining room at 10. Huh? Doesn\\'t that mean you close at 9:30 or really when ever you want? And it wasn\\'t even 9:30 technically. \\n\\nI ordered elsewhere and it was just as good if not better. And I probably saved us $60. \\n\\nI think I\\'m at the end point with this place. If they closed the Main Street location I wouldn\\'t be upset. Went to many fine Italian restaurants. This is one of the worse I\\'ve been to.  The service was bad so the food.   We ordered the seafood paster undercooked linguine too hard to swallow.   Took forever to get the check service slowww especially the place had a few tables.   We were charged twice for the same dish.  Lunch for two over $50 not worth it. Me and my husband went for dinner and found staff was very very very unprofessional and very rude then every seen in my life. If they do not want any customer then they should be closed and go away from this place. It seems like they were paying us to have meal. Staff tried very much to rush in order and even was not properly hearing what I say and  spoiled my vege wrap. This was my first and last visit in Qdoba Mexican Grill and also never recommend to any one By no means am I a sushi connoisseur but I\\'ve eaten more than a fair share of basic rolls, house rolls, special rolls, sushi & sashimi.  Eating here I kept it pretty simple, sticking with 4 basic rolls: California, Eel, Spicy Tuna & Alaska. \\n\\nThe California roll was typically non-threatening but much blander than it should have been.  The Eel roll was mushy, due to it having very little eel and too much sauce.  The Spicy Tuna Roll was pretty much awful and the Alaska Roll was fighting darn hard to be just about as bad. \\n\\nIn all my sushi adventures, I have never ever left a plate occupied with rolls staring me down at the end.  Its never even been close.  Well, tonight was the first. I actually left the place hungry instead of pressing on and suffering through the wreckage before me. \\n\\nOf course, others are free to judge for themselves, but I\\'m sure not going back. To those who do go, may your rolls somehow turn out a lot better than mine. We went there excited after reading good reviews on yelp. But it turned out to be a total disappointment! When we arrived, there was nobody in the front to seat us. After waiting about 5min, somebody seated us and left without even giving us a menu. Even as we were looking around to catch someone\\'s attention, the service staff ignored us the entire time. It is a shame because the place seemed like a nice place to go and our experience was disappointing. We felt awkward and unwanted. Had to leave without even getting chance to order our food. My wife and I stopped in here several months ago... Kicked ass but i honestly don\\'t remember which beers i liked and disliked. Now that i think of it, i don\\'t even know how i made it home that night. THIS PLACE DESERVES NEGATIVE STARS. The people who work here are atrocious\\u200b and the food is even worse!!!! The girls at the counter have the absolute nastiest attitudes I\\u200b do NOT understand how or why they are still employed\\u200b at this place. The food is overpriced and disgusting and FORGET about delivery they have ONE delivery driver and he takes forever, the food comes freezing cold and he TIPS HIMSELF on top of the delivery fee. This is 100%\\u200b not a real restaurant\\u200b and just a front for something\\u200b. Do yourself a favor and go right next door to Paulines Deli, the lady is as sweet as can be and the food is fabulous. I want to love this bar but it has failed me almost every time I have tried to eat here. I like to give a place a few tries before I completely write it off, as well as always giving servers the benefit (I worked in food service for years) but my last dining experience was the end. (I must inject that the bar tenders have always been fantastic, friendly and quite knowledgeable.)\\n\\nTheir chaotic seating arrangements are hard to handle, and would be much better if the wait staff was just slightly more attentive to the people waiting. Almost every time I have gotten a seat and ordered, I have received short answers or bad attitude from the servers. During my last experience, my boyfriend and I were there for food only, and explained this to the waitress (who looked like she was in a rush) in order to help her out. She quipped that she still had to check our ID\\'s and explained, sarcastically, the difference between a bar that serves food and a restaurant that serves drinks and how we didn\\'t have a choice about showing our ID\\'s. Great. This could have been explained in a polite way, or maybe even with some humor. \\n\\nOther great moments from different visits include our server walking away from our table after asking her about a type of beer they had on tap, snatching a menu out of my hand after ordering and not bringing us menus for about 20 minutes after seating us. \\n\\nIt is a shame, because the red flannel hash that they serve during brunch is AMAZING. I went here for happy hour with my husband and friend. I was excited about the great happy hours deals BUT there was a hair in the our food. The waiter was informed and he brought back a new dish. But he didn\\'t even remove it from the bill even thought he told us he would.  He gave us vouchers for two free drinks next time we came in. But later that night both my friend, husband and I had intense GI issues. I wouldn\\'t recommend going here unless you dont mind being on the toilet seat all day. The food this place serves up is tasteless and certain things are inedible.  I had the spaghetti and meatballs.  Not sure there was any beef in the meatballs at all. Sauce was lousy as well. Girlfriend had the meatloaf and couldn\\'t even eat it.  Waitress didn\\'t seem to care.  Probably happens all the time.  We will never go back! Another \"Italian\" that thinks he/she can cook. What a terrible meal!!! First we ordered a Caprese salad: the mozzarella wasn\\'t fresh, the basil was dry and in flakes (what!) and the tomatoes were not quite ripe.   I ordered a pizza, I must say the crust was delicious, the toppings were mushrooms, black olives and prosciutto:  the mushrooms were canned, and I don\\'t know why the cook the prosciutto (you don\\'t suppose to cook prosciutto it makes it rancid and salty).  My boyfriend asked for a chicken milanese that was terrible with some pasta with tomato sauce that tasted like tomato paste right out of the can.   The only positive thing that I have to say about the place is that the servers are extremely nice. While the idea of servers running throughout the restaurant serving meat fill of different types of meat sounded like Xanadu meets Caligula to me, I have to say I was disappointed with my first visit to Fogo De Chao.\\n\\nWhile the service was excellent, and the novelty of flipping my red and green coaster back and forth to signal more food never felt tired, I did have a problem with the quality. Numerous times asking for medium rare I was served pieces of meat that I could only describe as coal; now I get that it must be insanely difficult for these servers to keep the meat at a consistent temperature as they weave their way through a packed house of people demanding meat. But still - for the price, I expect something at least close to the desired temp. Especially since they were advertising it. \\n\\nAlso, the amount of salt on the cuts of meat bordered on absurd. I\\'m thinking cats would have a tough time licking some of the pieces I got. \\n\\nThe side of mashed potatoes tasted like instant to me; if they weren\\'t they were definitely watered down. The fried polenta had the texture of a hockey puck. I realize the main focus is the meat, but still, I\\'d like a serviceable side.\\n\\nI enjoyed the salad bar, and I loved the idea, but for the money, I don\\'t think it was worth it. Probably a good place to go with a big group of people, though don\\'t expect to hear too much of the conversation. The cavernous room created plenty of echo and a lour roar of everyone eating. Good coffee and nice and quiet BUT...we were told by one of the employees that they would be closing early, around 7:45, when it is posted as closing at 9pm. I think there were three customers in the place. Bad business. This is not a very clean place and the food is horrible I ordered two gyros, fries, and a lot of wings to feed the family not only did my family didn\\'t like the rock solid wings but my pit bull didn\\'t either and it was a shame because had to throw them out and the gyros were made wrong they were cold and had no flavor and this was after waiting for a hour and a half so I\\'m so disappointed because we only live right around the corner from them so it would of been easy for us but the customer service was also horrific I couldn\\'t make out what the owners was saying...his name was (Michael Lopez) I believe.... This was the worst Sunday brunch I ever had. Poor service, and skimpy serving size made this a bad Sunday morning experience.  Skip this place with all the other brunch options on the square!!! I would write a huge list of all the things La Peg did wrong, but honestly its not worth the time. Just don\\'t waste your time or money. Went with groupon.  Food was okay nothing really great and waitress charged for my husbands beer even though the groupon didn\\'t say it didn\\'t include alcohol.  My so just told me when he went they included the alcohol.  Won\\'t be bback there any way prices were high for the type of place Subpar, expensive Indian food, served by those who could care less. \\n\\nI LOVE high quality Indian food, and spotting this place off West Chester Pike, I thought I\\'d give it a try. If you ever have the same thought, you should resist the urge. \\n\\nIn spite of being the only customers when we walked in, we were at first ignored by the two waiters sitting at one of the tables. Finally, the sullen and younger man showed us to a table, but then went back to ignoring us. I know, I should have just walked out, but shoulda coulda woulda, right?\\n\\nAnyhow, the overpriced chicken tikka and curry lunch specials we had were both bland as could be, and came with literally a quarter of a naan. Then I had to chase down the so-called waiter to get the check. I truly don\\'t understand how dumps like this stay in business. HARUBLE........This makes my TOP 5 WORST EVER.\\n\\nAnyone who says this place has fresh fish is terribly mistaken. \\nPretty disgusting to be honest. \\n\\nSUSHI: \\nYou know good fish by the smell of it and the appearance. The yellow tail we had looked DRY, OLD, SMELLED funny... Really unappealing and painful to get through. (we only did b/c it was $18 a roll!) It tasted worse than food store bought sushi!\\n\\nCHILEAN SEA BASS:\\nDry looking, tasted mediocre. Plated over a very TACKY mei fun noodle that looked as if they went to the nearest buffet, scooped it into a bowl and plopped it onto a plate. \\n\\nFISH TACO:\\nIn a legit taco shell, tasted too much Mexican and not enough Japanese. \\n\\nI cannot believe how bad this place was. I am a sushi lover and to say that we were disappointed is a complete understatement.\\n\\nMoral of the story: Save your $100 and go binge at McDonalds. We were saved my my dear friend AMADA who saved the night by a delicious desert. (THANK GOD). First time there on Dec. 30. Really dissapointed. The wait for our food was incompetently long. Nice server was apologetic but still. We sat like two dopes at an empty table, no bread or rolls even, for 15 minutes waiting for our appetizers. Then another long wait for entrees and my wife\\'s was cold. Food was ok not great. Total time: we got there 6:45 and left at 9! For dinner, for crissakes, not hanging out drinking. Really wanted to love this place, too. This place just cannot get it together under new management. Please hire more cooks, and figure out how to reduce both ordering time and making the food before you go out of business. My review is specifically for lunch. At $20 including tip, this place is a rip-off. Ignoring the plentiful of other options, that are nearby at roughly half the price of Minado, serve fresher & better food, and provide a better value, I\\'d rather go to Menchie\\'s for lunch and get froyo. \\n\\nWhat you pay for is aesthetically pleasing plating. Large white plates with small portions doesn\\'t really work for buffet considering I\\'m only picking up the food and not eating off of it. So one would think that they would replenish more frequently given that there is a smaller amount available, but that would not be the case with Minado. There was no effort to replenish dishes for my entire time there. The food was lackluster and tasted stale and old. The variety of hot food was limited and having certain options empty did not help.\\n\\nOn to the sushi. I\\'ll start with the raw fish and the nigiri. The fish was not fresh at all based on appearances and taste. The tuna was a bright red color rather than the darker ruby that it should be. Normally I wouldn\\'t complain about that at a $10 lunch buffet but for a $20 SUSHI buffet to have the same quality as a $10 buffet, what\\'s the point in spending my money here. The sushi rolls are okay only because the quality can be masked through the use of spicy mayo and eel sauce.\\n\\nThe only positive thing I can say was the green tea ice cream was not great but pretty good. If you live closer to Plymouth Meeting Mall, go to King Buffet instead, it\\'s a much better value. My family can\\'t get enough of this pizza. I worked 1 block away for 10 years, 20 ? Don\\'t know. Can\\'t get into it. Burnt crust, cheese slices, pre-ordering, shi__y seats, edgy waitresses, and poor parking in a way outta the way place. Comon; I can do better. Hey YOU!! Yes, YOU, listen to me clearly.  Skip this place as fast as you can.  If anyone makes reservations for you, cancel them.\\nI decided to come to TSJ after my friend recommended a \"new place\" in her area.  I looked at the YELP reviews and then looked at the menu.  Since the menu looked good, and I wasnt in a \"have it my way mood\", I obliged.\\n\\nWhen we arived, we were greeted by a friendly hostess (and manager) who showed us to our seats.  Our server was very attentive, but the food was just..well...edible :$\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I each had the Kennet Square Mushroom soup, which was pureed mush.  It was to thick and salty and needed to be blended more or have cream or water added to it. I\\'d take a Campbells Mushroom soup any day over this $9 bowl of slop.\\n\\nFor our main course we each had salads that gave good presentation but fell short on flavor. I had a salad with Turkey Apples and Cranberry and I have gotten a better salad at saladworks.  I don\\'t understand what went wrong here. With Rouge as its big sister, I would have thought the food would be much better.  Note to management: get a new chef. \\n\\nGood service+tastless food+higher than your average prices=I\\'m not going back. Apart from the person who waited at our table, James P, the rest of the staff could use a strong training in service skills. The food was either full of chilli powder (samosa chaat) or extremely sour (saag bahar). Other dishes were okay, but not reason enough to bring us back. This diner has been a standard in our area for years. Unfortunately, it is my opinion that the food quality has declined. From the use of generic brand condiments, to cheap and frozen burgers, lower quality meat in steak sandwiches - something has changed.... Last 2 or three visits it\\'s become clear.\\nthe facility is clean - and staff is friendly - Just a shame it\\'s not the same quality ingredients. Way overpriced and just meh.  Main dishes took a long time to come out and were not very impressive.  I could make a better meal on my grill at home for the money spent.  Server wasn\\'t too attentive and didn\\'t seem to care our food was taking awhile.  I would not recommend anyone to eat here.  There are better places for cheaper in the city. After much anticipation, I was finally able to make it to Sabrina\\'s for Sunday brunch with friends. We tried to overlook our server\\'s bad attitude and enjoy our food. I had ordered a decaf latte... it\\'s 2:25am and I\\'m still awake on a night before the start of a work week. This tells me they didn\\'t make my latte as I had requested. I was also dismayed to find a hair in my yogurt. My husband\\'s smoked salmon omelette was over-salted.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry, I wanted to like it. But this place just didn\\'t win me over with its sarcastic server and the unfortunate hair. The actual worst business I\\'ve ever ever been to. Told my party it was $75 added it up to $250 somehow? And told us he was being respectful by getting it down to $150. Sexually harassed the girls I was with and would only take the boys seriously. I wouldn\\'t suggest anyone going here. Profiled the entire group I was with sorry we aren\\'t the right race. Was looking for a good birthday with friends. Food is adequate.owner is very rude and condescending. Ordered red snapper from all you can eat menu was definitely not fresh owner wanted to argue with us. Probably won\\'t be going back anytime soon til owner changes his attitude. He also stood over the table and made sure every one of us gave a tip and signed the receipt. So I\\'ve just moved in to the area, this was my second visit to Pita. The second time I came with my family during the lunch hour. I found this place threw Yelp, searching for Halal places to eat in the area. However I have had better. On one occasion the customer service is pretty bad, it seemed to be set more as a catering set up. The food is not made to order from what i saw. If i was passing by I would most probably eat here, but I would not make a commute out of my way to eat here. Seriously? I ordered online 2 hours ago. The estimated ready time was 10-30 minutes. I came to pick up after 30 minutes...they say they never got the order. But, the online portal showed that the restaurant confirmed my order a few minutes after I submitted it. AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER I\\'m still waiting for 1 Italian hoagie and 1 turkey club. It\\'s not busy. There appears to be 2 dudes working here who are extremely disorganized and cannot manage efficiently taking orders and making sandwiches. The main guy keeps cutting up meat for us to sample and condescendingly asking why I\\'m not smiling. He keeps calling me \"blondie\" and asking if I don\\'t like him. How about just make the sandwich that I ordered 2 hours ago? I\\'m just astounded at how absurdly long this is taking and how unbothered the guy behind the counter is. Literally no sense of urgency, and he can keep his condescending sexist comments. I don\\'t have to smile for you. Make. The. F\\'ing. Sandwich. This place sucks, and even if this is the best sandwich I\\'ve ever had, I\\'ll never be back. STAY AWAY Every time my father-in-law visits Philly, he requests that we have brunch at Parc.  I suspect the pictures of naked ladies in the mens\\' room might be the reason, and I don\\'t mind indulging the old guy.  As such, I have had more experiences dining here than I would like.\\n\\nThe ambiance and location beside the park obviously remain the same, but I have noticed a steady downhill slide in food quality and service over the last few trips.  The food had always been overpriced for what it is (especially at brunch when \"what it is\" is eggs), but has historically been quite tasty.  I always overlooked the fact that it was usually so tasty due to mass quantities of butter and salt.\\n\\nOn our most recent trip, our party of five waited over twenty minutes to get the coffees we ordered.  After they arrived, it was another thirty minutes to get our brunch entrees.  Fortunately, they were happy to keep providing our table with $10 pastry baskets in the meantime.  When the entrees arrived, the two French toasts looked pretty good, but all three egg dishes were cold.  My omelet, in particular, consisted of an overabundance of lukewarm rubbery egg wrapped around still-damp, cool spinach and goat cheese.  The accompanying potatoes would have been awesome served hot, but were just a greasy mess at room temperature.  Since my in-laws were happily digging into their French toast, I did my best with the omelet, but ultimately left most of my meal on the plate.  If this had occurred at a cheap, greasy spoon diner, the experience wouldn\\'t have been too bad.  However, we ended up paying close to $200 with tip for five people to have eggs, French toast, coffee and no drinks.\\n\\nI wish I could vow never to brunch at Parc again, but my father-in-law made three trips to the restroom during the meal.  I suspect he will keep offering to pay for crazy-expensive cold eggs as long as it gets him access to the facilities. Went here about a week ago the service was terrible the workers there were rude, especially the grill guy and they all looked miserable, and just looked like they hated their lives. Made my experience terrible. Plus they forgot to put cheese on my sandwich. I\\'ll never come back. Steves for the win everyone. This was my second visit and was unsure the first time as it was newly opened so today I decided to try again. Unfortunately I thought the food was pretty bland.. had to ask for extra olive oil and salt to season the broccolini.. the fried calamari were bland and consisted of more breading than calamari, the little bit of calamari there was, was chewy.  The rigatoni with porcini and truffle was also bland and unfortunately , only a slight hint of tartufo.. The parpardelle with wild boar was slightly too sweet, and I\\'m not convinced it was boar meat. No bread for the table as customary in Italian restaurants.  The bronzino looked cooked well and I was told was good as I did not have it.. but it was rather small for a hefty price. The pasta dishes however were good sized portions. I\\'ve only ever eaten at this chain going thru Philly airport a couple times a year. Used to be I\\'d grab a wrap on my way to the plane or getting off if I needed something quick, and they were always very satisfying. But the one I got a few days ago was half the size I\\'d remembered and so meager it was a huge disappointment, not worth the money. What happened? Won\\'t give them a chance to fool me twice. (Their brownies are still good, though.) We ate here recently and were totally ripped off.  We ordered fresh lobster and sea bass.  I guess it was our fault for not asking about the price but they charged us $40 for the sea bass.  I\\'ve never paid $40 for steamed bass especially in Chinatown!  After asking 3 times thinking it was mismarked they told us it was $20/lb and our fish was 2 lbs.  It really is ashame because I would\\'ve gone back if it wasn\\'t so expensive.  I\\'m wondering if we were just a target. after months of hearing fab things about this bar, i came to eat one night recently.  the beer selection is fantastic.  however if you\\'re hungry, go somewhere else.  the food was mediocre at best.  the burger and fries- flavorless and my boyfriend\\'s portobello sandwich really greasy.  we felt sick for several hours afterwards.  \\n\\nthe bottom line. eat before you go drinking at local 44. I tried this restaurant yesterday and while it was good I feel the portions were extremely small for the price and some of the food was very bland. I got the mock chicken salad sandwich on ezekiel bread with a side salad and a lentil soup. The chicken salad was so bland. I really wanted to try it because of other positive reviews but I would not get it again. The side salad was fine but it was basically just lettuce. The balsamic dressing was very good though. The best thing I had was the lentil soup. It was full of flavor and it was a good amount of soup for the price. For 2 people the total was $45 for lunch. I would like to try it again but spending that amount for such small portions is a hard pill to swallow. Caffeine...now that\\'s some old school ADD drug... When i wish i could give zero stars because y\\'all are HORRIBLE! How do you tell me there\\'s not chairs at the bar after I\\'m already sitting. That\\'s the most absurd thing I\\'ve ever heard. I ordered 2 shots & you add gratuity & the service wasn\\'t even fast so now i HAVE to tip 18%. I\\'ve been here twice & I know i would never come back. For $30 a head for dinner and the rave reviews here you\\'d think this place was something special. To me it\\'s just an above average buffet, and buffets suck (save for Indian ones).\\n\\nMaybe I\\'m learning that most sushi tastes the same to me - in any case I was not impressed. I expected a variety of flavors when sampling the extensive sushi options. No such luck. I liked the tempura mahi-mahi roll the best. Most of the other food, save the crepes, tastes like standard asian buffet fare, using some cheap oil that gives everything an odd flavor.\\n\\nAnd the green tea ice cream? Yum, ice cream with a bitter edge to ruin the whole point of ice cream! I wanted to be intrigued, but in the end I didn\\'t really like it, sorry.\\n\\nThose little flavorless cubes of cake they serve for dessert - that tells you everything you need to know about a buffet. Either that or the obligatory obese people roaming around, feeding like cattle, throwing all caution to the wind.\\n\\nMy opinion? Do yourself a favor and go to a real restaurant. When someone says \"buffet?\" just say \"no way.\" Never had a pizza so distasteful in my life. Weird because they bought the place from Mango\\'s which had the best pizza around.  You\\'d think they\\'d get the recipe as well.  Now I go to Oreland for my pizza. Second Strike... decided to give this place one more try and sorry I did. Severely understaffed took 15 minutes for 1st drink which lacked alcohol.  Ordered queso with crab...they brought our plain...leslie corrected when she saw. Won\\'t blame server who was running around like a chicken without a head. They had a political fundraiser going on in one of the rooms so management was aware they were gonna be busy but failed to add additional staff. Our order got \"lost\" in the kitchen an hour and a half later reminded server we we\\'re still waiting....she was embarrassed 10 minutes later received food which was decent but at that point we were ready to go home! Won\\'t be returning. It seems like this franchise is going downhill. Every time we go anymore the order has something wrong with it. The quality of the food isn\\'t as good and the prices have definitely gone up. The people working just seem overwhelmed and confused most of the time. Indian buffet?!?!?\\n\\nI\\'m not sure how I feel about that. In fact when we first arrived, I was adamant that this was a horrible idea. Unlike every other patron, I was the oddball out and requested to see the menu. Somehow it just felt better to order my food and not have every random person that\\'s wandered in from the street to breathe over my food. However....as we looked at the menu and compared it to the options available at the buffet, and realized that the waiter had never taken an order from a menu or had a menu requested during his entire employment and was able to communicate to facilitate this happening, the buffet just began to make sense. I believe it\\'s $11.95 or $14.95 for unlimited buffet access including a dessert. \\n\\nThe summary is that it was pretty tasty and affordable. I was not ill as a result and I would probably go back again. A very disappointing lunch. We had the lobster rolls which should have been called corn & celery rolls. Very little lobster meat-no tail or claw meat. My tomato & mozzarella salad had unripe tomatotes-come on it\\'s early September & there are plenty of fresh tomatoes around. \\n\\nI used to really enjoy Devon Seafood, but after my recent lunch I won\\'t be going back & suggest yelpers stay away! Such a good neighborhood spot, however, our food was absolutely sub-par. This was my first time here so I\\'m willing to go back and give it another whirl. Our first time here involved a chicken fried steak order that was literally fried into oblivion. Also, our fried chicken order was wildly overdone. Perhaps someone forgot about everything in the fryer that evening! I\\'ll give it another shot because I liked the atmosphere, drinks, and menu potential. I usually think of Fred\\'s as an eat-in breakfast spot.\\nHowever we picked up  a big take out basket of bakery goods for a catered party we were having and they were wiped out immediately. The caterer brought pastry, bagels and other baked goods with him which are still here days later... should have kept the Fred\\'s for ourselves! I had my wallet stolen out of my closed purse here last night. I felt the guy take it, but it happened so fast I couldn\\'t stop him. My friend also had her purse unzipped. Im told this is an ongoing issue at this place. DON\\'T GO HERE. We had a reservation and were seated quickly.   The wait person was attentive.  There are many items on the menu to select from. \\n\\nI should have known what to expect when there was only silverware on the table and no chop sticks.  This food was bland.  I expect Chinese food to have complexity in flavor.  I expect to be rewarded with ginger and garlic and if something is marked spicy for it to actually have spice.  And I also expect that if I am dining in the restaurant that the food is served hot. \\n\\nDan Dan Noodles - these were listed as a special.  They were not spicy, and barely had any meat in it.  Additionally while there was a sauce it was not thickened so it did not stick to the noodles.  Instead it just pooled on the plate. \\n\\nEgg roll- mostly vegetables \\n\\nVegetarian Shanghai Spring Roll- this was fine \\n\\nScallion Pancake- nicely done.  Crisp\\n\\nTa Chien Chicken- described as crispy and marked as spicy.  It was neither.  And the sauce was bland.\\n\\n\\nAnother chicken dish from the specials menu that was market as spicy.  It had a lot of tien tsin peppers thrown in with very small pieces of chicken (and I mean small).  The peppers weren\\'t cracked so you guessed it, this dish wasn\\'t spicy. \\n\\nFlavor  is key and this place was lacking.  If you like the idea of an outing for Chinese food and you aren\\'t keen on any flavors other than salt and pepper then this is the place for you.  If you want something more flavorful you should look elsewhere. I\\'m quite annoyed with my experience at this establishment. My partner and I were craving Greek food,which he suggested we come here. I despise the taste of onion. Don\\'t want want to smell them or have onions near me... I especially don\\'t want them on my food. I ordered my gyro without onion. I watched a man fix multiple gyros and saw that he put onions on all of the orders.  I got slightly nervous thinking one of these would end up mine.  My boyfriend told me not to worry that it wasn\\'t ours. Funny enough... I saw the man double check the tickets and he took a glob of the onions off a gyro.  I knew this one was mine.. I just knew it. He continued to try to pick them off and then slapped some more tsazikiti sauce on the gyro. Then I saw that he prepped the gyro to eat at the restraint (which we ordered ours to-go)... it sat on the counter for a while and then another worker told the line cook that it needed to be wrapped up because it was a gyro to-go. I was furious... not only did I see my food prepared incorrectly, I also saw it chilling on the counter forever because it wasn\\'t packaged correctly. \\n\\nWe finally get our food. We left the place to eat outside. My first bite into the gyro, I get a nice bite of onion.  I immediately threw it away. Thanks for jacking up my order. this place completely sucks. my girlfriend and i went in for a cocktail, smoked a cigarette, came back in -- and the bartender flagged us. the bar was completely empty except for us and we were far from even being tipsy. he overheard us talking about driving home, which was his excuse for flagging us but i reassured him that we didn\\'t need to drive -- that we were only 4 blocks from home and could walk. he resisted. i told him -- shes not driving, serve her. he still said no. this guy was a complete dick for no reason. neither of us were even near the tipsy we are capable of. stay away from this place. the bartender is a dick for no reason at all. the place is empty and will probably go out of business within the year. Stopped in here yesterday to escape the cold and grab a quick coffee. I love the seating arrangement here. It\\'s completely open out front and there\\'s a few more private tables towards the back. It looked like they had a couple of computers available for people who\\'d like to browse the interwebs.\\n\\nA few reasons for three stars:\\n1. Horrible, horrible, horrible music playing. Green Day? Jimmy Eat World? Various other shitty alternative rock groups?\\n2. You have to grab a key for the bathroom. A key attached to the sad, decrepit leg of what was once a happy table. It\\'s irritating to have to hold the wand of \\'I have to pee immediately\\' as you walk to the bathroom.\\n3. The bathroom is tiny, difficult to unlock (furthering my rage) and dirty. Normally cleanliness isn\\'t a huge deal to me... unless I have to put the toilet seat down. Definitely overrated.  I think people are too generous with ratings.\\n\\n1. A wait this long should be accompanied by something special.  An over sized plate of food is not really \"special.\"  \\n\\n2. The place gets so busy that it lacks quality control.  \\n\\n3. You leave and take the scent of the kitchen with you.  The open-kitchen is a cool concept for diners, but it sucks for patrons because we smell like omelets for 5 hours.   \\n\\n4. Sabrina\\'s however always has consistent (great) service, and the self-seating counter is a plus. Not a great experience. No minors allowed to sit in bar area with parents, in violation of PA LCB state rules. So basically they are discriminating on basis of age. No different than if they did so on basis of race or disability, like if they only let certain races or unhandicapped people in bar area, so we have a civil rights violation on our hands. Idiot manager was misinformed but didn\\'t much care anyway. Perhaps the ACLU should file suit, or if you are a shark lawyer reading this and want to shake down RR and its deep pockets for easy big $ settlement, go ahead look into it. Local news station might get good story out of that too. Anyway, burgers and service were sort of OK but nobody\\'s heart was in it. Doubt I\\'ll be going back. I didn\\'t like the service. I was waiting for my drinks for 15 min. Ordered salad was without dressing and with old leafs. this will be short, but not so sweet.  \\n\\nif it were for the decor and quality of drink alone, i would give this place 4 or 5 stars.  it\\'s nice enough to sit in once you get your drink.\\n\\nBUT some of the people who work here are the meanest SOBs i\\'ve ever had the displeasure or interacting with in this city.  just plain rude and pretentious.  and blatantly so, as if boastful of their douche factor.  i\\'m not saying all of the employees act that way, but at the risk of having to deal with one who does seem to think that serving coffee to the public is one big popularity contest, i tend to avoid it as much as possible.\\n\\ni would still go here before starbucks, but that\\'s really about it.  ouch, no? Marvelous lunch menu, but lacking in (cooked) seafood options.\\nDining rooms desperately need SOUND ABATEMENT PANELS, because  food and companions can not be fully appreciated with that cacophony beating on ones ears. This has got to be the worst Dunkin\\' Donuts in general. The one dude who works the drive through with his underwear hanging out tried to hand me two iced coffees which he was trying to handle with one hand. To make a long story short, he squeezed them together, the kids popped off, and coffee was all over my sleeves. Great way to start my day. Another time, as I was placing an order inside, the same guy literally walked away when I was in mid sentence giving him my order. He came back a couple minutes later without explanation, and asked me to repeat my order. Also, like someone else said, every time they make iced coffee there is so much cream that it\\'s white. Two stars instead of one because the staff was okay.  Some kid who had no idea how to bartend but didn\\'t drop the ball either.  Basically it\\'s another one of those places that, during the day at least, is a glorified hangout for members of the food service industry, with little in the way of customer service.  \\n\\nThe food is truly awful.  Decent if you\\'re drunk and just need to eat I guess, but in a city full of above average food this just doesn\\'t hold up.\\n\\nIt\\'s a mismanaged inconsistent and kind of strange bar, but the people seem nice enough. Had a gift card so DH & I thought we\\'d try it for my birthday.  I ordered the Art Sea Martini.  If you like sweet drinks, this is perfect.  I truly enjoyed it.  The edible art in the center tastes like frosting.  \\n\\nWe started with an appetizer & soup. The Corn Chowder & Lump Crab Soup was delicious. Had a nice creamy texture and flavor with a dab of crab meat presented in the center.   The Imperial Crab Dip is a misnomer. I don\\'t understand why they serve it with tortilla chips as this dip was lumpy and dry with the consistency of a very thick non-creamy mac & cheese that you could eat with a toothpick.  It did have a good flavor but did not live up to to \"dip\" expectations.  As we haven\\'t had it before we asked our server if it was normal for it to be so dry and appear like this.  Our server said yes it looked normal.  \\n\\nFor my meal I had the Italian Seafood Risotto.  You can\\'t go wrong with shrimp, scallops, asparagus, tomatoes, red onion, Parmesan Risotto with basil.  Can\\'t go wrong with this meal. But I did go wrong ordering this one. It\\'s very spicy!  My mouth, lips & throat we\\'re burning from the spice. Nothing in the description mentioned anything spicy.  There should be a warning on the menu somewhere. \\n\\nDH ordered  the Wolfish Lobster Rouille after our server described it as sweet tasting like lobster.  DH likes spicy foods but felt the spice was too overpowering to taste the fish.  \\n\\nWe were both disappointed in our meals. Our server asked the manager to speak with us.  He explained that we should have said something right away so they could have corrected the problem.  We explained that we didn\\'t want to be a bother when they were so busy and since we hadn\\'t eaten there before we didn\\'t know if this was how all their meals were. The manger did comp our soup & appetizer which was very nice as we do not expect to come back. Screwed\\n\\nI took my daughter and future son-in-law to Branzino after hearing great things and reading great reviews as a place to consider hosting their Rehearsal Dinner.  We were tolerant of slightly lethargic service on a Saturday night as the setting was lovely and we were comfortably tucked in a corner.  HOWEVER, when I found a small screw in my spinach salad, the quality of our experience shifted dramatically.  I called the waiter, he whisked both salad and screw away swiftly with a perfunctory \\'sorry,\\' and then.....NOTHING.   No owner apology, head waiter visit or matre\\'d apology.  After a while, I got up and mentioned this to the hostess.  THEN, the owner came over...But somehow we just didn\\'t feel as though they were really THAT sorry.  In the end, food might have been OK, but they charged me for the salad and comp\\'d two desserts.  While dollar-wise, we may have come out slightly ahead, there is NO way I want to go back or host anything there....They may have award winning preparations, but their handling of guests leaves much to be desired. We are frequent visitors to Koreana on 38th. We tried online ordering for the first time. One of us was a strict vegetarian and had ordered a \\'C4. sweet and sour cup bap\\'. The description for C4 did not mention meat as one of the ingredients. The vegetarian person assumed it was tofu since she didn\\'t know any better. I tasted it and couldn\\'t tell if it was meat. I called Koreana and the person was vehement about C4 being chicken and not vegetarian to begin with. After telling them about the description, all she said was \\'sorry\\'.\\nWe fell short of food because of this mishap and had to buy again elsewhere - neither did they offer to refund, which I thought was quite insensitive to vegetarians.\\nOverall, I don\\'t recommend it to vegetarians, but for others it is one of the better options for Korean food in Philly. This place looks nice, but it\\'s always dead. There is no customer service, and the staff & managers are rude. There were about 8 people there on a Saturday night; every table was roped off for a VIP section even though there were no customers. After ordering a Johnny walker at the bar I got scolded for  placing my coat on one of the 15 empty roped off couches. I would have gladly brought it to coat Check but they don\\'t have one. Do not  waste your time at this has been, no scene place . Tons of other bars/lounges in philly with better locations. It pains me to even gone this place 1 star!! No membership and no cover = rude patrons, bland music, inept bartenders, sagging decor.  Yack.\\n\\nAnd hula-hoops - I thought flagging was bad in the 90\\'s, but hula-hoops on the dance floor?!?!\\n\\nRemember 212?  Well, it\\'s been taken over by rude, drunk sorority girls and homophobic horny hipster boys who can\\'t dance.  This once fierce, fun, funky after hours trip down the rabbit hole is now just another nondescript straight after hours club.\\n\\nAfter hours in the 2010s has never been so boring. I went last night with my family. Primavera has been our go-to place for YEARS. I don\\'t know what has happened, but the place has definitely changed and not for the better. It is clear they have a new management, new staff, new menu. Everything is  different. It used to be a nice place but it is obvious they are scaling back. The former menu had TONS of delicious options, but this new menu is very limited and our party of 6 noticed that immediately. They have swapped out the linen napkins and tablecloths for paper. What the? We were taken aback by these changes, but we stayed and gave it a shot. The food was mediocre, and it was obvious that the new management decided to limit the menu, make portions smaller, and raise the prices. That\\'s a \\'recipe\\' for disaster.\\n\\nBottom line, it\\'s just not the same place that has kept us coming back as \\'regulars\\' all these years. I never had a bad experience here EVER until last night. This place has really gone downhill. If it stays like this, they will be forced to close. We certainly won\\'t be back. Terrible customer service. Asked the person taking me order to explain my options, only to be answered with \"what do you want.\" She gave me a bowl of spinach with a tiny scoop of chicken because she would not explain the options to someone who clearly could have used an explanation. That is clearly not worth the $11 they charged. I would avoid this place and go to one of its countless competitors that are offering the exact same product but with better customer service. This place has terrible service. When I came here with my family: it was not busy. There were 3 other tables with people seated at them; and those groups were not large. We ordered our food, but it took more than 20 minutes for everything to arrive to the table. We had to call out to a waiter three times to get extra napkins, utensils, and drinks: In fact, we ordered a prime rib at the start and it took 50minutes for it to arrive! Oh, and the shrimp balls tasted awful! Their only saving grace was their tea. That\\'s right: tea. Their tea was great, delicious, hot, and infinite. It\\'s sad when your tea is better then your primary entrees. I would pass on this place if you hate waiting. My 1st note is as a disclaimer - this was a serendipitous visit with friends on New Years\\' Eve - which of course is the worst night to go out. \\n\\nThe food was okay, but the very poor service overshadowed what was an otherwise lovely evening.  You\\'d think that a table of 4 that were clearly drinking and ordering 2 courses each, would elicit some sort of positive behavior to earn a good tip - Unfortunately, they got the tip, but we didn\\'t get the service.\\n\\nOf particular note:\\n\\n1) The female bartender/ cum buser, was arrogant, dismissive and even sarcastic.  She clearly didn\\'t want to be there and took it out on the patrons. Her attitude was apparent as soon as we ordered drinks at the bar (prior to moving to a table) where she was helping the waitstaff.\\nShe really had no right to be nasty  - especially because we were a pretty laid back group - and I will likely never step foot in this establishment again due to her.\\n\\n2) Dirty/empty glasses and plates were not removed, and when I asked for them to take away a course worth of dishes (after 35 minutes of staring at them,) and to refill the water glasses, she tapped my water glass with the tip of her finger and said  \"there\\'s your water glass \"- It took another 10 minutes to get my wish. During the 45 minutes of sitting there no one approached our table for any reason...to ask, to inform - NADA.\\n\\n3) The server was very confused - period.\\n\\nThis place could be good if Management cleans house and demands a competent, friendly and solicitous staff. We typically enjoy going to arpeggio but last night was a very average meal at best. Certainly not the usual quality. The appetizer was the best. We had a Mediterranean platter which is really quite good but we should\\'ve stopped there. Thankfully we had the Zatr bread which was the best part of the meal but the pita that came with it was pretty bad. My side salad was anemic, tasteless and the waitress was annoyed when I asked for a different dressing on the side. My wife\\'s vegetarian penne was again average at best as it was not very tasty. Perhaps the worst meal of the night was the Mediterranean chicken and marinara sauce. This is the first time I have had it and was very disappointed. The last couple of times I tried other dishes that were very good but this was a dogs breakfast. It was limited chicken, overwhelmingly too many olives and the other vegetables of last week. The worst part of this which should\\'ve been one of the the best parts was the marinara sauce which was horrible. Very disappointed. will we go back? Yes as every restaurant is entitled to a bad night but we would never order some of these things again. Maybe they are getting too big for their britches. Time will tell. Remember if you were looking to have a conversation over dinner this is not the place. The waiter in the bar area may have been trying to be humorous but he came off as borderline obnoxious, even offensive, to me and my friend. That, combined with an almost comical series of errors when we tried to put in a gluten-free burger order (first, it showed up on a bun, then missing the fries) makes me not want to go back. Worst place in the city. I have tried this place numerous times. The bartender, who may be some amateur manager, is rude and slow. Everytime I go here and try to sit outside I\\'ve been ignored. They staff only serves their friends. The restaurant is always empty. I have no idea how this place is in business or how anyone could have a good food or service experience. Avoid with all costs. This place will only leave you feeling angry. Happy hour or any hour this place has to go! Horrible!! Not real this food. Greasy and flavors were off. Disgusting! Waited until second visit - hoping that our first experience was not the norm. But, clearly the focus is on turning tables as quickly as possibly- with no regard to the natural progress of enjoying a meal.  Service was slow & staff comes across as totally disengaged... I get it that runners are running food - but little enthusiasm when delivering food, was a bummer. Food is definitely decent - I\\'d suggest eating in the bar, might be better service? Hopefully things will improve - the time management of table traffic really needs improvement. Can\\'t believe how badly they were pushing us out... particularly when we had to wait 30+ mins for our reservation... I have hope for this place if management gets it together! Unbelievable. I Am actually taking time out of my day to write a review on this mess so that no one has to go through this ordeal.\\n\\nWe waited for 25 minutes before anyone even took our drink order. The COMPLETELY disinterested and sluggish waitress took over an hour to get us appitizers. She spent more time flirting and chitchatting with her coworkers than attending the tables.\\n\\nMeanwhile the two managers and the rest of the staff stood around and socialized with themselves.\\n\\nSome of the worst service I have ever experienced. I would rather eat Taco Bell.\\n\\nTrendy looking Mexican restaurant in a residential area. It\\'s a real shame the food is awful. Mexican food should taste crisp and fresh. The word I would use to describe all the appetizers was tepid. I also sat close to food area and saw food sit out for quite awhile before it was picked up by wait staff. \\n\\nExcellent beer selection. This summer my friend Abby randomly texted me during the middle of my workday and asked if I had any interest in being interviewed by Gordan Ramsay for his show Kitchen Nightmares.  \\'Duh\\' I replied and asked permission to leave work 3 hours early to go be an extra on the show.  At this time in my life I had never been to hot potato or planned on going because I had read several horrible reviews on the place and that\\'s exactly what I said when interviewed. \\n\\nCut ahead to the fall and my friend Abby gave me and my girlfriend at the time gift certificates for our birthdays... I was hopeful and a little hesitant to go to this restaurant and this was my free chance to.  So off we went last night to hot potato for a not date.  \\n\\nI commented as I walked up that it didn\\'t look like it was open.  There were two tables of people inside and it was cute and clean.  The service was really great and the food came out fast...but thats about all I can say for hot potato.  The food was not good. We had the crab cake app. perogies, potato crusted salmon and shepherds pie.  Is it a jerk move to say I think the frozen perogies from trader joes are more delicious?  I had never had shepherds pie but I feel like there is a possible correlation between their shepherds pie and cat food.  I don\\'t think the salmon was fresh and neither of us finished our food, nor could you have paid me to do so.  Another weird aspect of this place was the fact that we got there at 8, the two other tables left 5 minutes later and they closed the kitchen right after we received our food.  Other customers came in at 8:15 and they were turned away because they closed down.  weird?\\n\\nI will give many places more than one chance to win me over but I think hot potato is not one of them, which is sad because its so close and I like supporting my neighborhood businesses. I don\\'t know if it\\'s just me but, I had the worst meal I ever had in my entire life at this place. I went with my family who told me this place had good food. I\\'m starting to question my family for putting me through  such an awful culinary experience. They suggested menu items to me and ordered what sounded good. I tried everyone\\'s food and to be honest it was all awful. Everything tasted awful. I had the grape leaves they were awful, had the falafel and that tasted like a deep fried sand castle and fro dinner I had the shawarma platter and it was disgusting. I never in my life sent a meal back at a restaurant but this was almost the first time. It would of been insulting to send back that many things so I kept my mouth shut mainly because I was fighting the urge to not to vomit. Ok, after going here now for 8 years I have beef with this place.  My family thoroughly enjoy the food here still every time however there is so much attitude with service!  Is the staff that miserable and bitter?  From the hostess (that can barely eek out a smile and makes it seem so painful to do so) that\\'s been there forever to the older waiter and the middle age waitstaff- there is no thank you or greeting???  We have gone there so many times and no recognition or welcome back?...  Gone are the original owner Benny\\'s thoughtful ways and warm smiles....  I thought it was a prejudice thing the last time we went (there were a few minorities at the table) but I took a good look around today and it was to everyone!  I think I will start going across the street and tell my family/relatives/colleagues and friends to as well! We stumbled in here for lunch because I was craving sushi and wanted to try some place new.  So I yelped and found this 4.5 star sushi spot in washington square.  Being 4.5 stars on yelp, I had some expectations.  The inside is fairly small, with mainly tables along the walls, pretty tightly packed.  So tight that if you are just a little overweight, you might not be able to squeeze through the tables to get into the wall side booth seating.  It is pretty small and cozy.\\n\\nWe ordered the spicy 3 which came with a miso soup, also ordered the philadelphia roll and pennsylvania roll.  The spicy 3 included 24 pieces of sushi combo of yellowtail, tuna, and salmon.  When it came out, I seriously could not distinguish which was tuna, salmon, or yellowtail because they looked exactly the same in color which is odd because yellowtail is lighter in color, should be clear.  The fish did not taste fresh at all.  To be honest, it tasted like the typically sushi you find at the mall.  Even wegman\\'s sushi is better than this.  \\nOn the other hand, I found the Miso soup to be pretty delicious and flavorful served on a unique looking fish bowl and soup spoon that I almost wanted to take home.  Overall, their sushi is really mediocre but I guess you get what you pay for.  FYI, this is a BYOB.  Sushi restaurants are a huge competition in the city because there is just so many to choose from.  This one really need to step it up compared to fat salmon, vic sushi, etc.\\n\\nAs for the service, it is just SO SO - being that it is kind of an asian restaurant, I don\\'t expect much when it comes to service as usual.  But I asked for a box for the rest of the sushi and he either forgot or just ignored it.  Either way, we left without packing, sushi wasn\\'t good anyway, I probably would not have finished it by home.  I definitely won\\'t be back. The store was always outrageously expensive with poor quality produce but at least their bakery was good.  Now their bakery has really gone down hill.  We ordered 2 cakes in the past month - the first they totally messed up the order on and when I called to give the feedback the female owner yelled at me for not knowing better when and how to order their cakes.   The second cake was chocolate cake with white buttercream frosting.  The icing was tasty but the decorations were minimal and disappointing  with pale yellow writing that barely stood out against the off white frosting and the chocolate cake was absolutely dry.  I am going to go to Cramers for future cakes. Mi Lah is thoroughly meh. We came for brunch, split a couple dishes, probably won\\'t return as there are better vegan options in the city.\\n\\nThe pumpkin pancakes were actually good, but nothing else was great. The OJ was from concentrate. The tofu Benedict was probably the worst I\\'ve ever had. It was very dry tofu, smothered in ok tasting sauce, on barely toasted, stale whole wheat English muffins, served with incredibly greasy greens. Nope. If I could give zero stars I would, I waited in line for almost 15 minutes and when it was my turn the guy told me to wait and then he decided to take the group of people behind me instead. He totally ignored me, so I decided to just leave. Will not be returning We wanted to return back to Parc which is few doors down, but we were in the mood for seafood and wanted to try a new place while we were staying at Rittenhouse. \\n\\nIt was ok, very disappointing for what turns out to be quite an expensive meal. We don\\'t mind eating and paying for expensive meals, as long they do the job as right! It\\'s seafood! I ordered the ahi tuna as my main entree which was over cooked! Hardly any flavor. My husband didn\\'t care for his entree either, our son had the seafood over pasta, he wanted linguine or spaghetti but they only had penne. So it was all wrong and they put grated cheese in his seafood with red sauce?!? Who does that?? It gave a very off putting taste, but he was so hungry that he finished half of his plate. \\n\\nWon\\'t return and really wished we stuck to our original idea of eating at Parc. Rude staff, unpleasant and do not know how to work, and appear miserable. They do not know the rules. I have been here before, but this the worst staff I have seen. Disappointing. Came for the Philly cheese steak. It was very fatty and gristly. Very poor quality meat. Flavor was good, though. Came back a second time because someone ordered the trash can nachos that looked good. Once again, the meat was   chunks of fat. No smoked brisket, but cubes of nasty fat. The place has such great potential, if they would just stop using cheap, gross pieces of meat in their meals. If Guy knew this place was cutting corners on quality food to save $1, then he would not be happy. I placed an order for a party platter 4 days before my event. I spoke directly with the owner who said it was ok to do so. Midway through the week there was a snag at the restaurant and my order was mixed up after a few conversations with the owner and screenshot of my original owner we were back on track. On the day of my event the owner reached out to me to confirm my pick up time. Unfortunately , none of the staff knew about this. I had to wait 1 hour for my food because they had to cook it.  The staff didn\\'t know all that was included in my order so I had to tell them. When I got to the venue the bag they placed my order in fell apart and I lost part of my food in their poorly packaged system. I received no apologies. The food was good but it was supposed to feed 15 and it barely fed the 11 present. I will not be ordering large orders like this again. It is obviously too hard for them to manage. Especially with an absentee owner/leader. I\\'ve wanted to try Mi Lah for quite a awhile now and finally stopped in for dinner last night. Pretty psyched. Unfortunately, the meal just didn\\'t impress us. \\n\\nBoth my boyfriend and myself are vegan so eating out can be difficult but living in Philly there are so many delicious places to find great vegan food. Mi Lah makes a good effort but the food is average, at best. \\n\\nIt\\'s a cute little hole-in-the-wall BYOB restaurant in center city with seating both up and downstairs. Very little ambiance, no music, semi-attentive staff. Our server had no shame watching videos on his cell phone throughout our entire meal. Not a huge deal, but for $18 entrees, at least turn the volume down!\\n\\nWe ordered the sampler which was a random mix of tofu, some fake meat patty, and a yummy salsa. Nothing on that plate will ever be ordered again, it just all tasted microwaved, bland, meh.\\n\\nI ordered the mushroom/veggie phyllo pocket with cashew cream. We must have a different definition of cashew cream. The entire meal tasted freezer burned and also like it was made a month ago and reheated. My boyfriend ordered the Brazilian tofu/seitan/bean dish which was actually very tasty. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate cake which was ok but tasted also like a freezer burned Easy Bake Oven delicacy. \\n\\nI\\'m hesitant to come back to try brunch since the prices are outrageous ($17 for microwaved food?) . Seems a bit risky after our \"Meh\" La experience. We used to go there a lot and It was great. But it\\'s bad now. The waitstaff are slow and don\\'t really care ...the owners should come in more often and bring in better servers to make it great again! Where to begin? Seated 40 minutes after reservation mostly because hostess, who told us to wait at bar, whom we checked in with 3 times still forgot to sit us. Bar tender had to go over an scold her. The clientele average age was approx 65, so we stuck out! The food was fine, nothing special. The person who came to show us deserts forgot what 2 of the 6 items were, I thought we were being punked. In the end, we just left bored. Not bad, but no reason to ever return I wanted to like this place, because it is cheap and close to school for me.  However, only once in my life have I had tuna that I thought was bad, and it came from Ajia.  The tuna was almost black and smelled funky.  I ate one piece of the roll and it tasted off as well.  I ate the other two rolls in my combo and they were fine (about what you would expect for the price point).  Now, to be clear, I did not get sick.  But I still can\\'t believe they served that to me.  It was clearly passed its prime.  Also, to be fair, this was during the summer, so turnover may have been extremely low.  Regardless, I won\\'t go back unless forced, and if I am forced, I won\\'t be ordering sushi. Not a fan of this Dunkin. Although they are normally quick with getting the drive through moving, the food and drinks are normally poorly made, and they can be rude. I\\'ve also had them try to overcharge me on more than one occasion so I would highly recommend checking your receipt. The last time I came here they weren\\'t accepting gift cards, promotions, or coupons. Even though it seems as if those items would go through the same cash register as the regular one, they said they weren\\'t accepting them because the machine was \"down.\" However, they did just build a wawa across the street, so not sure if they are hurting for business and didn\\'t want to accept anything that would decrease the total cost of payment. A McDonald\\'s cashier here asked me if she could borrow my money. Totally unprofessional and out of line. Staff is often rude and the crowd is a bit sketchy. Avoid if possible. This restaurant is closed. Dave Magrogan\\'s Stella Rossa opens in this location August 4, 2013 If you are a vegetarian, please do not dine here. In general, I stay away from French restaurants as a vegetarian. However, after reading the reviews of Laurel, I didn\\'t think it qualified as your typical French restaurant that would not cater to a vegetarian who enjoys delicious food and I decided to celebrate my wedding anniversary here. That was a terrible decision! My entire meal consisted of mere meat substitutions for each dish - my husband would receive a dish on the planned menu, and my dish would be the same thing with the meat replaced with broccoli or endive or sometimes nothing at all! Absolutely no thought to a separate vegetarian tasting menu taking into account what actually pairs well with the vegetable(s) being showcased. It was just terrible. Honestly, can\\'t believe I paid for this meal. Terrible end to a great anniversary. Vegetarians who enjoy delicious food that is not an afterthought or substitution (or complete omission) please avoid. There are plenty of other restaurants in Philadelphia who respect vegetarian food. The best part of my meal was the wine I brought myself! Good cheesesteaks, including a vegetarian version. (Note, as they will tell you when you order, cooked on same grill and with same utensils as meat.)\\n\\nNot cheap - for a cheesesteak. Beware when ordering when they ask you about extras like cheese whiz or mushrooms, they charge extra. Cashier is rude-like (think Seinfeld soup Nazi), something I didn\\'t find fun. \\n\\nMoved across aisle to new booth- no seating!\\n\\nFrequently slow-moving long line. Not worth the wait. If short line, give it a try, but order carefully to avoid upcharges. That stromboli was dry and tasteless. Even after I specifically asked for extra cheese there was barely any cheese inside. Never again, but thanks anyway. Horrible service for good but overpriced Chinese food.  I had takeout from here once prior to dining in the restaurant and it was good but I did find it to be more expensive than other Chinese restaurants. When planning a holiday gathering with colleagues, we decided on Han Dynasty because it was a BYO and the gentlemen who we spoke with on the phone had assured us they could accommodate our group of 12.  When we arrived they had us at 2 separate tables, we were promised one table for our group.  We waited for some time but no one brought us menus, we had to go get them ourselves from the hostess stand. Our tables were not set either.  We also had to ask for ice and glasses, and our server seemed rather annoyed by this request. Throughout the meal our water was never freshened and once our ice was gone that was it.  It took forever to finally get our orders in, then food started randomly coming out family style but no one informed us we\\'d be served that way.  Oh yeah and even though they brought out or food family style we had to ask for plates to eat off of. We got doubles of some of the food we ordered...they just kept bringing the same things out, then when it came time for the check they never brought it and when we eventually got it there were a lot of mistakes.  Clearly they can not accommodate large groups well. This place is a hot mess that cant function when they\\'re in the weeds.  For what they charge they really should get their act together. There are few restaurants that lead me to write reviews, but such a poor dining experience has led me to put pen to paper so to speak. The ambience of the restaurant is good and the restaurant is accommodating to children. The appetizers of a wonton chicken soup, Chinese broccoli and veggie spring rolls were all pretty good.\\nHowever, the entrées were very bad. We ordered spicy lemongrass soup. The soup was not spicy and worse, the chicken was bland. Upon asking the waiter about the soup he said it \"was not spicy\" despite spicy being in THE NAME of the dish. When we asked the waiter to take the dish back, he did so quickly and did not ask if we would prefer another or if he could do anything to help. We also had beef dishes that were better, but still bland. I recommend searching for another place to dine if flavor is your prerogative for the evening. I wanted to like it so much but as other reviewers states, the service is so slow. Our actual waiter was attentive and apologetic but it took an hour to get our appetizers, mussels which lacked taste. We waited another hour to get our dinners. Luckily we enjoyed our company but once dinner was served ours was cold and one person had to wait an additional 15 minutes. We were offered dessert but when we were finished, the server ask if we wanted a check and there was to mention of it again. However, we were there for over 3 hours and were ready to go. Food was okay, and service was bad. I\\'ve eaten here several times and the food was great.  But the service and the food today was a  hot mess. This place really needs to invest in staff. You have one person running all over trying to do everything , I would would have felt bad for the girl if I hadn\\'t waited 45mins for my order to still be wrong, I wasn\\'t waiting another 45mins for the right order at that. There was so much curry sauce in these cheap little takeout containers that the one on the bottom broke through, plus there was only four shrimp and all rice. When my food is sloppy and messy as if he cook took zero time to prepare it I can\\'t eat it, so I just had to take the $40 loss and find something else to eat at another business. IF YOU HAVE A LARGE ORDER FOR AN IMPORTANT DAY STAY AWAY!!\\n\\nThe food is good but the customer service is horrible.  My husband ordered 17dozen of crabs- 11 hard shell and 6 sautéed with 2lbs of mussels, over $500. He pre-ordered them early afternoon on Friday, August 31 to be picked up on Sunday, September 2 at 7 PM and he left a  $300 deposit w/ a $40 tip. However,  when he and my brother went to pick them up on Sunday, September 2 he was told they needed 15 minutes and they will be ready. After 40 minutes they still were not ready and eventually he was given only four pans of crabs totaling six dozens of sautéed and six dozen of hard shell meaning there were 5 dozen still missing.  But he was told that was his complete order. So he proceeded to count out the crabs himself and only at that point did they acknowledge their error being five dozen short. And then they said they needed more time. Needless to say after waiting 1hr-15min, he got the crabs and they gave him a Styrofoam container of my 2 pounds of mussels which was wrapped tightly with plastic wrap.  When my husband finally got home after missing our daughter\\'s surprise entrance that was to start at 8pm, we opened the Styrofoam container and found out we were given 2 pounds of shrimp and not mussels. Also many of the crabs were mushy. So the moral of the story is if you want to order large trays from them it\\'s better for you to order their sauce which is fabulous but get your crabs from ShopRite and do it yourself. Their customer service was not very good,  they made us wait forever despite us having such a large order. It was like they would rather wait on the customers that had one or two platters versus our  six trays. You do the math! I have been here several times because of the close proximity to where I live, so this review would be based over the past year and a half of regular visits (monthly).  The service is absolutely lacking MOST of the time.  Expect your server to disappear for 20 minutes after your food is served, and you have to flag one down to get your check and even longer to get your card back if you paid with a credit card.  For example, I recently went in for a drink and appetizers and the entire experience took an hour.  There were only 11 people in the entire place, so I found this to be completely unacceptable.  The bartender was too busy texting away to notice us sitting beer-less and bored in the cantina.  \\n\\nTo avoid being completely ignored, opt to sit at the bar (not even the cantina though- you\\'ll still get ignored!)  They also tend to get the orders wrong, (asking for a side of guac and they bring you out the expensive and dauntingly large $8 plate, then tell you that you ordered the wrong way instead of clarifying to begin with) and miss you when your beer is completely empty.  Dos Segundos is best at their busiest hours when they\\'re properly staffed, like Sunday brunch.  I would like to see a secret shopper initiative in this place to keep them in check.  It appears as though their wait staff and bartenders are hired based on their \"hipster\" appearances and not their actual ability to keep customers happy, which I feel is a general problem with Northern Liberties dining.  \\n\\nI\\'ll keep coming back because I don\\'t feel like walking the extra 2 blocks to El Camino Real when the weather is bad, but it\\'s a cheap cop-out compared to their rivals in Liberties Walk.  The ambient lighting and indie music give the immediate appeal, and the food is good enough, but Cantina Dos Segundos loses serious points with the mediocre service. I went for lunch and got the Vietnamese hoagie.  I picked it up and it was absolutely dripping oil.  You\\'d think that an $8 version of a $3 sandwich should be slightly better.  Not at all.  The tofu was soft, and I\\'d call the entire affair greasy and boring. Was excited to try this bakery and went out of my way to get there. The cupcakes lookes grocery store. Nothing special. The croissants looked amazing so i got a pan chocolat. Got home to eat it and was devastated to find out it was at least a day old. Totally stale! Blech. Had to throw it out...wast of $4. Will think twice before going back. Sorry. Hope you guys figure out what needs to change soon. Potential to be a fantastic place. Fogo de chao is one my fav restauRant.. Last 10 years I\\'ve been to Atlanta , Orlando, Tampa , Puerto Rico overall 30 plus times but this place was worst ever ! Service was bad limeade was bad ! Horrible meat service ! I left within 30 mins! Didn\\'t enjoy my meal at all... Waitress never came back to clean table nor replace new plate .. Waited 20 to get my cheese bread ... Horrible this place Lived in Queen Village for 6 years and have been to Southwark many times although never for dinner. Historically was one of our favorite places. Drinks are good but the atmosphere has always been a bit cold and despite our frequent visits the bartender/owners has never made an effort to make us feel welcome. Friday night at 6PM they had only one glass of Chardonnay and made no effort to either recommend a similar wine or open another Chardonnay that was only offered by the bottle. They offered no apologies simply blaming the State Liquor Control Board. I have been to other restaurants that go to a local Wine Shoppe to keep their inventory stocked. Maybe the newbies Kennett and the to soon to open Cichonski\\'s restaurant in Ansill\\'s space.will get them back on their game. VERY rude costumer service. I placed an order at 11pm and was told it would take 45 minutes to an hour. (Fine no problem) .. The restaurant closes at 12am and it is now 12:20, so I begin to become concerned, because I have all rights to. I give the restaurant a call and luckily someone answers. All I asked was \"hey I was wondering what\\'s the status of my order?\" very nicely. To them be told passive aggressively that they\\'re are protests going on, they have 29 orders and I need to be patient. I expressed that I was just concernd but before I knew it I was speaking to the dial tone... yep! They hung up. \\n\\nI felt completely disrespected as a kind costumer that wasn\\'t even looking for trouble.\\n\\nBe sure to check the news before ordering from these people. if it\\'s bad weather or over 29 orders, they may be pist you even called. \\n\\nVery disappointed. We just felt like having pho on this cold evening. We went here for dinner. First and last time. Although the papaya salad was good, the pho was probably the worst we have ever had. I got the seafood one and the squid was raw. Not gently cooked, the noodles were one big soggy pile stuck together.  The vegetables that were served for the pho were beyond dead. They truly should not have been served. Overall the restaurant did not appear to be very clean. I might add that we are pho aficionados. Trust me save your money. Yesterday was Local 44\\'s sixth anniversary. That gave me a reason to think about how it\\'s changed since it opened. I lived around the corner then. I was delighted, the food was great, service was personal, and the atmosphere convivial--I gave them five stars then. It continues to be the only gastropub in the neighborhood. Perhaps some competition would have helped them maintain that quality. \\n\\nSix years have taken their toll. The food seems an afterthought now. Over the last year, I\\'ve had one too many meals where the food has been undercooked. Nevermind that the kitchen seems incapable of cooking a burger to temperature. It doesn\\'t matter what you ask for, it\\'s always rare. The bigger problem is chicken. Twice I ordered fried chicken, and thrice it was visibly undercooked (I sent it back the first time and the replacement was also undercooked--I settled for a salad). \\n\\nIts slow descent south of mediocrity has cost the neighborhood one of its treasures. Alas. We used to like Girasole and the food is still good, but the service is execrable and has gotten worse, to the point where I doubt we will ever go back. We waited at our table (and it\\'s a small restaurant) for 45 minutes before anyone even approached us. We had to ask for a wine list, bread, napkins and, ultimately the check. While waiting, we actively searched on Open Table for another place to go, but it was late on a Saturday night, so no luck The first time I came here I waited 20 mins just to place my order. I was the first customer and I thought that since they just opened they were learning. The second time I came here there was one person ahead of me and it took about 15 mins to get their order in and then help me. I asked a simple question and the cashier couldn\\'t answer it. The atmosphere is great and the place has potential but the customer service is so bad. I\\'m German. If this was for authenticity,take off another star. The menu looked very promising, the wait staff was great, the food was not. Specifically:  the potato pancakes fried to a nearly burned crisp. You had to use a knife to break it apart. A German puffer is golden brown and usually all you need is a fork to break apart. It comes with a bit of sour cream. A small spoonful of applesauce would have been appreciated. \\nThe Pommes with jaeger sauce. -- the sauce tasted like it burned at some point and was still served. No, it was not the smoked taste of the bacon. It was a scorched sauce. We ate it, but it was definitely burnt. (How did the kitchen let this out???)\\nThe smoked salmon dish -- super fresh salmon which was unfortunately set on a fresh bed of beautiful greens which were drowned in oil.  Barely any acidity in this \"salad\". -- some lemon or vinegar would have been greatly appreciated. Also, a LOT less dressing. I was literally wiping the dressing (oil)  off on my plate before eating. \\nThe sausage platter was ok but the sausages were not the real deal and some lacking flavor. \\nAt this point we did not pursue any Nachtisch (dessert).  An extra star was given for our server (long blonde hair -- sorry, I forgot your name). She had some spot on recommendations for drinks -- beers/ales and was very attentive.   She saved the meal. I wish I could say this place was better, but I can\\'t. The place is tiny with limited parking. I expected authentic Italian food but food was not fresh and tasted frozen. The \"eggplant\" parmesan was a stack of undercooked eggplant with no cheese, no side of pasta, and a little bit of sauce. Halfway through the meal, they had the door propped open on a very cold January day, the whole restaurant was freezing. One highlight-the creme brulee for dessert was pretty good. How the mighty have fallen...\\n\\nFor as long as I can remember, Ray\\'s has been a staple here.  Ray himself is from the area, knew his customers, and loved to give back to the community.  Two years ago, this would\\'ve been a 5 star rating without a doubt.\\n\\nRay\\'s earned the right to do what he wants with the company, and his choice was to turn over the managing aspect to someone on the outside, and it\\'s been downhill ever since.  The waitstaff are a lot less friendly, and the quality of service is horrible.  Two things keep this from being a 1-star review: 1) Their ice cream sundaes, which are somehow immune to recent downward trend 2) 10% of the check will be donated to a local charitable organization of your choice.\\n\\nI want to love this place again, but ever since the ownership change over I can\\'t bring myself to stop here again. PROS: Fast service, large portions, cheap\\nCONS: Greasy sushi that looks better than it tastes\\n\\nI was here with a LivingSocial deal. The sushi was warm, heavy, and greasy, and leaves you feeling like a sick, bloated dog. The recommended red snapper dish was overly sweet, as was the iced green tea. In fact, we were not at all satisfied with the meal and the bill came with gratuity auto-charged (when we were only two people)! Definitely not returning. Unfortunately the food wasn\\'t very good.  I don\\'t understand why anyone would give this restaurant a high rating. The calamari was well over cooked, and I ordered a chicken risotto pasta dish that frankly, sucked. The chicken was rubbery and had a bloody taste (kind of like some dark meat chicken tastes). In hindsight I think it was undercooked. It could not have been high grade. There was very little risotto and the dish was small. I wish I had sent it back. My wife pushed her plate away and later, said she didn\\'t like it (seafood pasta) and I noticed that our two friends, there with us, barely touched their dishes. I live locally but will not go there again. I guess being voted the best bar in philadelphia sent my expectations soaring to unreasonable proportions. Realistically, there wasn\\'t anything grossly objectionable about Grace, but I left feeling disappointed.\\n\\nEchoing what\\'s been said by a few folks before, the service on my visit was surly and offputting. My buddy with me leaned over soon after our first interaction with the bartender and asked in a hushed voice, \"Why does she hate me?\" Good question. Couldn\\'t tell him. It was the kind of service that made me want to crawl over the bar and pour the brews on my own.\\n\\nThe plus side to Grace Tavern, and it is a major plus: Walking in during the afternoon hours makes you feel like a film noir star. The sunlight peeks in and casts gorgeous shadows over the deep dark room, and you feel as though you could be a lonely, forgotten housewife embarking on an ill-advised affair with the private eye you hired to investigate your adulterous hubby. That kind of cinematic atmosphere is rare and precious, so soak it up kids. Hell, maybe the pissy service adds to the dramatic effect. Had a cubaño torta ...it was awful; bread would be great on a meatball hero but not here. No fan or AC here so if you\\'re not in gym clothes, the clothes you\\'re in now ARE gym clothes. My friends had various tacos and were not impressed. Overpriced for what you get for sure. It truly was the worst brunch experience of my life. Not only was my \"breakfast sandwich\" on a roll that smelled plasticy, it was disgusting. The waitress didn\\'t even ask me how we enjoyed our meal, probably because she knows it was the equivalent to animal food. What the hell is that in the photo?? The service was ok, but the food was definitely a let down. The sweet potato fries were burnt and did not come with any sauces and the brussel sprouts were unseasoned. The cleanliness of this restaurant is very questionable the floors are covered with food and a table is being kept from rocking with a bunch of folded up napkins under the leg of the table. Tried to order 6 wings but they only serve 12. Asked to do half garlic parm half hot and they said they don\\'t do that. Was really hoping to enjoy some coffee here with a friend...However went this past Wednesday @7:30am when it says they open at 6am and they were not open. My friend said this was the second time she arrived to find they were closed during a time when they are suppose to have been open. This place is just awful.  I had a tuna sandwich yesterday, and it took 20 minutes to get a top to the sandwich!!!!  We gave it a second chance, and my friend asked if they served mojitos.  They said yes, and he set up shop.  Well, after arrived, no mojitos!  i don\\'t care if they are on IDine and save you 20 percent of the bill.  This place is a Con, hence the name. I booked a reservation for this restaurant 3+ months ago for a graduation brunch. While the food was relatively good, the service was simply unacceptable. I arrived promptly at the restaurant at the reservation time, and was told they were running behind a few minutes. No problem - until a half hour goes by and other parties, including parties of the same size, were seated beforehand. We were not offered complimentary beverages or anything while awkwardly waiting at the bar, but instead were told they will try to \"make us a table.\" Had it not been for a graduation event, I would have certainly taken my business elsewhere. I really don\\'t know what everyone is talking about.  My partner and I are vegan and were SO excited after reading Mi Lah\\'s vegan brunch menu.  But our food was bland, rubbery, cold, and totally subpar.  Worst of all, we both got a little queasy after eating.  It was just a disaster.  Will never return!  Vegans, beware, don\\'t be tricked! We came here for restaurant week around 9:30pm on Friday.  The food was good, but given what you get, I wouldn\\'t call this place a good value (but I can only speak for the restaurant week menu.)  \\n\\nThe reason why the three stars, is that despite the late reservation, the entire meal took over 2 hours to serve.  We ordered at around 9:45pm, and while the appetizers came out quickly, it took forever for the entrees to come out.  The restaurant was not packed so I don\\'t understand why it took so long. 45 min and counting.... Still waiting for our breakfast. This food better be worth the wait. At least the coffee is decent. Very disappointing, ordered for appetizers shrimp rolls that was ok.\\n\\nFor entry ordered the lemongrass chicken, the chicken had an aftertaste and felt like the chicken spent many day in the freezer.\\n\\nSupposed to be spicy but was more on the sweet side. Ordered chicken and rice soup for $5.50  and they gave me canned chicken noodle Progresso soup. Nice try. What a scam VEGETARIAN REVIEW:\\n\\nAppetizer:\\nWe ordered some kind of bread too, it was just really crispy with a lot of oil on it. No flavor besides bread & oil.\\n\\nPizza:\\nPizza was undercooked & sauce had too much basil in it. Cheese had no flavor. It didn\\'t taste like that stringy or delicious mozzarella cheese I\\'m used to getting.\\n\\nBeer:\\nBeer selection included a few craft beers, which was nice. \\n\\nService:\\nGood service! It\\'s probably why I gave it a two instead of a one. \\n\\nDecor:\\nCute... it would be a good first date place.\\n\\nAlso, it\\'s more of an upscale place so don\\'t expect any traditional pizzeria appetizers like fries or mozzarella sticks!\\n\\nNOTE: I came here for pizza, it wasn\\'t good. I\\'m unsure about the pasta, so please don\\'t let me deter you away from that. I want to try to remain unbiased. But, as far as coming back:\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t come here again nor would I recommend it (for pizza). I\\'m poo poo-ing this establishment for the following reasons:\\n* ineffective security:  my camera, which i had just gotten and was being pretty careful about, was stolen when i was there, and i was one of at least four people to whom this happened! BE CAREFUL!\\n* the bar setup is not conducive to efficient service when crowded\\n* unnecessary sass from bartenders\\n* they charge you for water\\n\\nmore details:\\n\\n* stolen camera:  before you think i was just a sloppy, irresponsible mess, please note:  (a) i was debuting my new camera that night and was being pretty careful about either keeping it on my wrist or putting it in my purse and (b) i was one of at least FOUR people who had either a camera, cell phone and / or purse stolen that night... coincidence?  doubtful.  pure has an elaborate security setup, but it\\'s clearly ineffective, and it is my civic duty to give a one-star review to a place that cannot offer a secure environment for its patrons\\n\\n\"  when the place is crazy crowded, the bars are understaffed and not physically setup in a strategic manner that allows for more free-flowing libations\\n\\n\"  having worked in service before, i sympathize with bartenders dealing with needy, obnoxious patrons, BUT that does not warrant a bartender yelling back at someone (not me, FYI) upset about not being served \"Get over it!  You\\'re not being served right now, get over it, you asshole!\"\\n\\n*  i asked for water or a club soda to hydrate, and they opened a bottle of generic spring water and asked for $5... FYI, miller lights are $6, so if you splurge $1, you\\'ll practically get water with a little kick\\n\\ni wish i could like this place for its decor and music, but such a traumatizing experience... i\\'ll definitely think more than twice before going back! My order took 3 hours and 20 minutes to be delivered. The only explanation I got was that they were \"really busy\" and a half-hearted apology from the driver. The food was ok, but I\\'ll not be patronizing this restaurant again after the atrocious service. Check out Khajuraho in Ardmore for a much better experience and better food. I\\'ve been eating at Khajuraho for 10+ years and rarely had a bad experience. They typically deliver in less than 15 minutes. I should have stayed with the tried and true... Horrible first and last experience. Order through grub hub a chicken salad wrap, I got a chicken wrap. When I called to see if they made a mistake they told me that they do no carry chicken salad. Then WHY! have chicken salad as an option. Also, it said the wrap came with chips but it really came with fries. If I would of known that, I would not have ordered an extra order of fries. Additionally, we order a cheese turnover which was suppose to come with tomato sauce....took three bites of it and still could not find any tomato sauce. Just cheese. Will never order again. I bought the Dockside Classics Buffalo Shrimp Bites as appetizers during a football watching party.  I thought buffalo shrimp would mean little shrimps inside a tasty breaded spicy bite.  OMG.....this was nothing more than a hushpuppy with a little shrimp smell.  There was nothing spicy...ie buffalo about it.  There was no shrimp whatsoever!!  I only paid $5, so I guess I should have known better.  But, really 10 little buffalo shrimp bites with a package that says  \"Made w/ Real SHRIMP,\" and \"Made in the USA\" made me think this would be somewhat decent.  I wanted shrimp so bad...so DISAPPOINTED!!!  NEVER BUY THIS BRAND!!! Flat lies in their advertising! It\\'s 10:12 pm. We arrived in the drive in line at 9:42. That\\'s half an hour. Still waiting on the drive in. Now, yes, I know. Stupid us for waiting all this time. I\\'ll accept that. But half an hour for sub-par food? We certainly will not be back. Hope corporate reads yelp reviews because this location needs serious help. My husband and I went to Parc for dinner last night - we\\'ve always loved it there and have always had an excellent experience. Last night however was different. While the food was excellent as always, the service was not. We were seated up front, in front of the hostess table. After we ordered, we felt the waitress was not thrilled with us - we didn\\'t order alcohol, or appetizers, and for dinner, my husband ordered the omelette (which, by the way, he said was the best omelette he\\'s ever eaten).  We could have dealt with that. What really got us was when we asked for our check, we saw she had it in her hand and instead of dropping it off at our table, she stood directly next to my husband with her back to us and chatted with the next table for about 10 minutes before dropping off the check. That was just rude and uncalled for and tainted our experience at a restaurant we usually love. \\n\\nThe one star is for the rude service we received. Ordered 2 bagels; a classic and burger.  I received the burger bagel after 15 minutes and waited another 5 for the classic bagel. The burger bagel came out raw, if not alive, and the classic was over spread and underwhelming. Both bagels were put together poorly and a complete mess to eat. Unacceptable especially when the total came to 23 dollars. Would not recommend. Don\\'t waste your time with Tiffin\\'s bland dishes.\\n\\nProceed directly to Ekta for a spicier, more authentic, and less expensive Indian experience! Went for lunch with my husband. The service was not good. The guacamole and tortilla soup was ok. The rice that came with the entrees was good. However the steak fajitas and the beef chimichanga were bad. I\\'m from Texas and grew up with Mexican food and when you serve fajitas they should be on a sizzling hot plate. The steak had zero flavor and the chimichanga had hardly any beef in it and was filled with veggies. Also they were out of there medium sauce which I find strange and their mild red sauce tasted like a marinara. And for what the food prices are it should be a lot better. I\\'ll maybe go back for a margarita or try their Cuban food but will not for Mexican food. I\\'m truly disappointed as I was hoping it was be great. Heavily inflated prices because I believe they are offering deals on Groupon. We visited here for dinner and was heavily disappointed by the food. We ordered the chicken tikka masala and aloo gobhi. Aloo gobhi had more potatoes than the cauliflower. And the chicken wasn\\'t fresh as mentioned by my wife. This place was definitely not worth a drive. I might try the buffet if I am in the area. Our server was good. The one star is for the food. I ordered a burger and ended up so sick I had to miss work the next day. I won\\'t be returning. Also the menus need to be cleaned. They were filthy. STAY AWAY !!!\\n We have never been so disappointed ,First of all  for a wine bar, they didn\\'t have many of the items listed on the wine list and what they did serve seemed to have been open some time ago . The food was cold and no one at our table had a good meal .Would never recommend . $3 for a 12oz bottle of Sam Adams. $4 for 12oz bottle of Ommegang. WOW. No thanks. Huge selection and I love that their individual bottles are refrigerated, but the price is literally outrageous. Went to resturant \\n on Wednesday August 17 thank goodness food was good because our waitress was down right rude. We sat inside 4 woman and from the beginning she had an attitude. Now I just want to say we are a group of nurses that go out frequently together and we are anything but difficult.  It is a byob when asked her to open bottle took quite awhile. I asked for a glass of ice she said they didn\\'t have any. She said she would put wine in freezer took bottle and sat it on top of freezer next to a hot coffee pot. Then I spotted another waitress giving someone else a big glass of ice. Once again asked for ice again she said she didn\\'t have any. Finally asked busboy and guess what we got ice. Our meals came wine still by coffee pot had to get someone else to get bottle and open it. I didn\\'t understand this attitude towards us we ordered our food and asked for ice that was it nothing difficult. By the way she did give us a carafe \\nOf warm water without us asking for water. I did notice others with frosted carafes of water. The food is good, but the environment is awful.  The dining room is crowded and noisy.  We\\'ve been there more than once and had the same bad experience.  We were constantly bumped by wait staff and other patrons.  People from other tables were in our space throughout our meals as they socialized.  Too chaotic for a relaxing meal with friends.  Service was not what I would expect from a restaurant in this price range.  Disappointing considering it is close to home and we\\'re always looking for good restaurants. The sandwich wasnt too bad but should have come with broccoli rabe as opposed to spinach. Roast pork sandwich maker and cashier were rude and miserable as hell! Went here on a Friday night a few months ago.  I\\'m writing this review now, because I will never forget ignorant bartender we came across.  I know I know, servicing the public is tough, I get it.  However, how can a 50-something year old man get SO angry when I told him the club soda was flat.  Was it my fault?  No.  But I interrupted \"guy time\" at the bar.  He wanted to enjoy laughing with his two other 50-something work buddies.  Then I asked for a menu.  You\\'d think I was asking him to do the most unbelievable task. I\\'m saying, he literally rolled his eyes at me when I so dared wanted to order food at the bar.  You know what we did?  We asked for our drink tab, $0 tip and left.  It\\'s too bad for him and Three Monkeys, I also work with the public.  Bad reviews travel much faster than positive. Not only was the food terrible, the service was horrible. I have never been waited on by a more unpleasant person. They are not interested in having patrons return. Very disappointing! I wish yelp had 0 stars, this place is God awful!! I know, I know its burger king but its so filthy and disgusting and it was shut-down and reopened so they can clean, the health dept should just do the NE a favor and shut this place down. After reading all the positive reviews, we had friends in town and decided to go to Townsend for dinner this past weekend. It was unfortunately disappointing. The staff was great and very knowledgeable but the food was nothing special. We got the mushrooms, beef tartare, foie gras, and Hamachi to start. The hamachi was tasty but the other apps lacked flavor and the foie gras didn\\'t taste very fresh. As for the main courses, the rabbit was dry but the duck was cooked very well. Considering the price and other amazing options in Philly, we will not be back anytime soon. ok food, poor service.  Like many other reviewers, I agree that this place used to be great.  When the owners were present, everything ran smooth and service was excellent and fast.  \\nNow the place seems staffed with high college kids and the service is non-existent.  \\nWe went tonight and the curly-haired pot head tried to pass off the leftover scraps of chicken as adequate.  My girlfriend\\nrequested a new one be made and we waited 10 minutes for them to refresh the chicken, while smokey joe sat at a computer.  \\nThe chips also stink.\\nThey replaced the rewards punch-style cards with a credit card styled card, but after handing the new card to the cashier multiple times over multiple visits I was told the card had never been activated and there were no credits on it.  \\nWe\\'re moving soon and though I will return to the city to eat at our fave places, sadly machismo of Manayunk will not be on that list.\\n\\nBTW, this place closed down for good recently (2013) We had a terrible experience today. \\n\\nSaturday night. We arrived and see a very spacious clean restaurant. Lots of space between tables and a large dance floor. However, food was lucking flavor, especially salads. Service was not great. We had to ask for water. We were disappointed This place was terrible. The staff were some of the rudest people I\\'ve came into contact with. Our waitress had a puss on her face the whole time and made our table feel extremely uneasy. I ordered a soup which she forgot to bring, and when I asked for grilled chicken with my BLT wrap she flat out told me no. She didn\\'t offer to check with the kitchen staff or anything. So I got a burger instead. Food was mediocre too. Overall, one of the worst dining experiences I\\'ve ever encountered and I would never come here again. By George was the first stop for me when I arrived in Philly for the first time. I wanted to check out the Reading Terminal Market and was craving some Italian food after my flight. I saw the huge display of Italian goods in front of me and decided to get the baked ziti. It was a bit pricey, because the portion I got was a smaller carryout container, but I figured it would be good due to the high ratings on Yelp. When I ate the ziti it had a good flavor, but the pasta got really soggy and was breaking apart in the sauce. Also, what got me the most was the excessive amount of cheese that was in the dish. I refused to consume that much cheese after I ate all the pasta. I am not exaggerating, it was at least two pounds of cheese in the container. I tossed the almost $10 \"ziti\" and was fairly disappointed. Sal\\'s is overrated my snow crab legs and shrimp\\nWas ok kinda dry I could of did better making it at home sorry!!! I also stopped at this Target and again could not find the item in question.   I was able to find a Target Team Member here who made honest effort to help me locate the item the website saId was in stock but was nowhere to be found.   She tried to locate the person who works that area on the walkie but they did not respond but she persevered.   Unfortunately we were not successful but this young lady did her best. We are NOT going back to this restaurant due to horrible service, lackluster food and so-so beer.   Went to dinner on Sunday night- there was about 4-5 other tables with families sitting down for dinner - so by no means were they busy.   We (party of 6) waited approximately 30 minutes for our dinner to come out (we did not order any appetizers - they are over priced any way). Three of our dinners came out, than 10 minutes later two more.  When I asked the waitress about the last serving for our table - her snappy sarcastic response was \"Of course it will be right Out\".  Well another ten minutes went by and finally I had go find the \"manager\", who was going to take care of it.  The last entry came out and per the manager this order was to be taken off our bill (it was).  What a disgrace that it took a non busy restaurant 50 minutes to serve us  4 burgers, a taco dinner and a chicken dinner.  Also we had to get our own napkins and utensils as the staff did not set the table.  Lastly we find it rude when we visit a restaurant and have mix gender at the table and the staff addresses us as \"guys\".  You guys ready to order?  Real classy place and staff at ABC. Unacceptable, amateur operation in a respectable neighborhood. Go read the reviews on TripAdvisor. My story is \"a walk in the park\" compared to some of the reviews listed there! This place will be out of business in no time. Save your hard earned cash. I wish we stayed 5 more minutes to see why the police showed up at the place!\\n\\nhttp://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g53338-d1987602-Reviews-Black_Horse_Tavern-Newtown_Pennsylvania.html#REVIEWS Went with my husband and two children on a recent Saturday evening.  They  were moderately busy, but had open tables including the one next to us who were on their second round of drinks and whose appetizers were coming out before we even had a server come to our table!! My husband approached the hostess who said she would send someone to our table but after another five minute wait we finally walked out.  Anthony\\'s pizza may be well done but at this location their service definitely isn\\'t!! Waited 25 minutes for a burger..  The wrong burger came out.  They gave my burger to someone else.  Waited another 30 for the original burger that I ordered.... never came!!!  Paid for my club soda and received my change from a hundred dollar bill $10 dollars short!!!   Bad all around!  Manager never came over..  I couldn\\'t get a $20 burger if I paid for it in this place!!!   Lolol!   Never again!!! The restaurant is ok. Not a lot of options. We went there for lunch. It was mostly preheated food from the night before. Giving a three star because the Waiter was nice. This place is awful and I cannot believe that people rated it so highly.\\n\\nThe house made beer is an ale which is fair tasting at best. Besides that, the closest thing you can get to a good beer is Blue Moon. I only gave Three Monkeys two stars instead of one because the filet mignon cheesesteak is somewhere between fair and good. The nachos are a bowl of tostitos scoops with skank cheese whiz on top.\\n\\nIf you do feel like venturing here, make sure to not go on a game night, because that\\'s when the townies are partying. Scary. I was excited to try this place out. I got the sirloin cheese steak(fried onion and white wiz) and first Street fries(white wiz).\\n\\nThe cheesesteak was ok nothing special but had a weird taste so I wasn\\'t sure till I ate the soggy fries(overpowered by the seasoning) with the sauce. White wiz sauce didn\\'t even taste like cheese or a anything. Had a weird after taste. I stop eating it and threw it away. \\n\\nFrom here on it went down hill. Around 3 am in the morning my stomach was killing me. I had to vomit couple times and I thought I could work in a few... No it got worst while I was at. Thankfully I took some medicine and was sent home. I was pretty much food poison by their white wiz sauce. I am still sick and have diarrhea for the past 2 days. \\n\\nI would stay away just in case you don\\'t want to end up like me. We decided to give this place a try since it was a grand opening. The 5 of us came and sat down and ordered when another family came about 10 minutes later and sat down at the table next to us. Next thing we know, the other table had all of their food served to them while we were still waiting for our order of spring rolls. When they finally came out with the appetizer, they gave us summer rolls. We told them of the mistake and after 5 minutes, finally received it and the next thing we know, they send out another order of summer rolls. We told them again that we did not order summer rolls and they took it back.  When we finally received our food, they brought out the wrong dish. The seafood soup dish was really bland, the noodles were clumped together, and the scallops were bad. The beef dish was asked for without peanuts, but this had peanuts and had to be returned. The pho deluxe was a small bowl that had just meat...we were looking for the rest of the ingredients when finally they bring out a little bowl of meatballs. We were still looking for the rest of the ingredients. The pho itself was pretty bland.\\n\\n Anyway, they bring back the beef dish again and they still got it wrong ...it was supposed to be with rice and not noodles. \\nWe just kept it as we were all hungry from the wait and wondered if they would get it wrong again. The water jug also did not get refilled. \\n\\nOverall, a horrible experience. The manager did apologize and offered to take off the cost of the beef dish since they made it wrong twice and also gave us the appetizer, but I doubt we\\'ll be coming back anytime soon. I walked into the store to get a slice and the two employees at the front kept talking as if I was invisible. I waited for about 4 minutes but they did not even acknowledge my presence even though the one guy looked directly at me. They then continued their conversation and turned their backs toward me still ignoring me. This place sucks. It\\'s dirty inside. I remember when I stopped by the fish department, all I could smell was cigarette smoke and dirty fish. All the workers look miserable. The produce is rotten. This \"market\" is certainly not the definition of fresh. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and tried their fish, but I got sick. Plus the apples that I bought were either tasteless or just brown. I will never do business here again. They have no excuse for being dirty. This place should me closed down for selling trash. I can\\'t believe I wasted my time and money here. Sheesh if you people are going to sell food at least make sure it\\'s fresh. Not every American likes to eat crappy food. Had some drinks at Johnny Brenda\\'s on Saturday afternoon. The COVID transition has not be smooth and as harsh as it may be, I would not return until the inside was reopened.\\n\\nQuality: I could not put my finger on Johnny Brenda\\'s and I think a lot had to do with not being able to go inside. In general, they seemed to be trying too hard to do everything and as a result were not doing anything particularly well. Our table ordered a bunch of cocktails from the list we were given and no one was impressed. My selections were JBs Mule, as expected, and the Spiced \\'Rita, which was just cinnamon dumped on top of an average margarita. The eclectic food menu, ranging from raw bar to empanadas to vegetarian dishes, seemed like a maze, so we thought it safe going with JB\\'s Wings. We were wrong. They looked terrible and tasted nearly as bad. I think it is a matter of simplify and master a few items, but I don\\'t know how easy that is during COVID.\\nQuantity: The two cocktails I ordered were decent size and quite strong. JB\\'s Wings came with enough for two to share, but were not very good so got left behind.\\nValue: $9-$12 for Cocktails. $13 for JB\\'s Wings.\\nAmbiance: Johnny Brenda\\'s is located in the Fishtown area of Philadelphia. I believe on the inside is a stylish gastropub and music venue, but right now it is only outside, and little about it stands out. They have some picnic tables on the street, which are too close to busy traffic to let you feel comfortable. It also is near a traffic light, which guarantees cars will be idling and spewing exhaust right in your face. Again I understand they are doing what they can to survive, but it is a bit of a disaster.\\nCrowd: It was one of the few bars in the area with tables open on Saturday afternoon. There were other guests, but it never got so busy people could not get a seat.\\nService: They were easily able to accommodate our larger party and our bartender was very friendly, but drinks were very slow. It seemed like they were still adjusting a lot to outdoor seating, so expect hiccups in service.\\nParking: Limited street parking in the nearby area. Still lame.  This place has to be the worst.  Gave it a second try, but the staff are rude and the food sucks. Had a surprise 30th for my sister, the banquet room was very nice, and the food was good. I was disappointed that our Dj had to compete with the band that was playing in the bar that was connected. They did not tell us they have a live band every Saturday night. Half way during the party our guests had to run out to make sure we did not get a ticket, or towed, the parking lot is not to big, and the lot next door with meters charges all night, we were not aware of this. And last we chose to not include mixed drinks on our bar, we paid out of pocket for those, the drinks were very under poured, and watered down. Not worth the $5-8 dollars you pay for it. The food was good but unfortunately came out cold. The cosmos were not so good and tasted like a bad mix!!! The food is VERY mediocre and I\\'d actually give it about a 2 out of 5. Food quantity is fantastic. Food quality is mediocre at best. The entertainment act deserves a 3-4 star rating while the venue itself gets a 2 out of 5. It looks very rundown and a like a bad strip club from the outside. The inside is better but still sorely in need of renovation as it\\'s dated, worn and stinks of that old food/musty smell. This place is well past it\\'s prime. We went for an anniversary party so didn\\'t pay for ourselves but I did look into doing NYE there in the past and was floored at how much they\\'re asking for NYE admission. Fortunately we went somewhere else as I would have been very disappointed to pay that much and be so disappointed in the place. They sorely need to renovate this place and find a chef that can pump out some better quality food. A good party otherwise if you can overlook those things. Why oh why doesn\\'t your register accept a credit card with a chip reader?  The cashier made me enter my card number manually. Absolutely ridiculous!! The only reason I threw 1 star up, for what little filling there was in the Strawberry Rhubarb Pie, it was kind of flavorful.\\n\\nIn addition to the annoyance of bringing a desert to a family party, which I was embarrassed of, it actually cost $28. \\n\\nThis the 2nd let down out of 3 purchases.\\n\\nOver priced and way under executed, steer clear. These guys moved from their (good) old location to this new one in mid-March and have really botched things.  I have to echo all of the reviews you see since that time period.  We went on a busy Friday night and received some pretty sub-par service as compared to that we would have received at any of the neighboring eateries; it took us nearly 3 hours to finally be placed at a table and served our meal while.  Once we were FINALLY seated, we constantly barraged by confused waiters trying to mis-deliver other people\\'s food to our table.  \\n\\nThe food at the old location was phenomenal but something was lost in the move and now everything seems to taste pretty average and lack luster.  Mind you, the new stuff isn\\'t choke-on-it-bad, but just boring compared to the old.  We had margaritas were poorly conceived and pretty undrinkable, the only good thing about them is they came quickly.  For an appetizer we had chips and guac which never ended up showing up to the table.  For dinner we had a few different tacos which were all bland.  \\n\\nI was really hoping an established Main Street business would come in and break the curse at this location but, if things keep up, I\\'m afraid it won\\'t be long before 4161 Main street claims it\\'s sixth victim. While this place does its best to replicate New York\\'s Pastis, all it does successfully is offend. I waited with for a table for 15 minutes while several white couples without reservations were seated. There were several clean, open tables that they refused to seat us at, claiming that they were still \"being worked on\". It is horrible to go on vacation and find yourself discriminated against at an institution that you are planning on giving your money to. Utterly saddening. Don\\'t waste your time here. I\\'ve tried this place for the second time and it will be the last.\\nThe first time I ordered take out and thought, the food really blows. Even the guacamole was tasteless. I\\'ve had better at chipotle. This time I went and fined in thinking maybe it would be a better experience. While the ambience was nice, the food sucked! So disappointed. This place has so much potential and all they need are a few minor changes. Maybe starting with getting tortilla chips that aren\\'t stale. \\n\\nI ordered the short rib tacos. The short ribs themselves and whatever else was in the taco was actually pretty good. However, as soon as I picked the taco up the soft shell immediately fell apart. It was complete mush. It had to be some sort of cheap store bought shell. I could understand if the food was take away and sat out a while. Then the meat would saturate into the shell causing it to fall apart, but you just brought it out... how does that happen? At least I can say I saved myself some carbs because I could only eat the inside of the taco. The shell was useless and gross. \\nThe service took forever. I don\\'t know if it was the waiters fault. He seemed to be the only one working. Maybe some additional staff would of been nice. \\nI won\\'t be returning here. This is a great location with barely any competition in the area. It would be really nice to have a good quality restaurant. This isn\\'t it. Worst service I\\'ve ever encountered. I went in with two friends on a Sunday night, we were one of two tables in the entire restaurant. I tried to wave down the waitress/bartender for a glass of water. The owner saw me and deliberately ignored me. It took 5 minutes after that to actually just get a glass of water. We ordered a bottle of wine, the waitress proceeded to open it at the bar and brought it over to finish. She could not open it, and once she had assistance she simply poured the glasses. She did not give us taste or present the bottle. At a restaurant like stone rose I would not expect that. When we asked when our to go order would to be ready, the one man actually checked the computer and rudely told my friend she had only been waiting 20 minutes.  For spending almost $200, the servers were rude and we left unsatisfied. The gnocchi was terribly bland, and was only palatable after dousing it with Parmesan and salt. Used to like this place but after tonight, I will not be back. What a joke we made a reservation 2 weeks in advance we showed up with15 people we were treated like we didnt exist we sat around for a half hour waiting for someone to help us the help banged into us now and again for we had nowhere to go trapped standing around we finally left never again id rather go to applebees at least id get treated like i mattered Empty Bar at 5:45 and No Happy Hour Specials..\\nNo thanks, plenty of other options.  Bar service was\\nUnfriendly and poor considering the place was empty My wife and I stopped in for dessert and a couple of Mexican coffees after a show in town. The waitress never heard of a Mexican coffee.  Apparently the bartender hadn\\'t either. We had to ask if the coffees had liquor in them. $15 for two small coffees with no liquor is a bit steep.\\n\\nThe dessert was better. It was mediocre. The food was ok. Not great but not bad. The reason for the two stars was the service- or lack of service. There were five tables filled including ours. Two waiters. They seemed to be more interested in their phones than us. We had to wave our arms to get their attention because they were constantly looking down. I almost got up and walked over to them. When we asked why it was taking so long for our dinner we were told there was only one chef. One chef and two waiters for five tables and we waited 45 minutes for our meal? They comped us dessert because of the wait but it didn\\'t make up for the non-existent service. Neither us nor our dining companions were impressed and won\\'t go back. I get the same thing everytime, bacon, 2 eggs (over medium) & cheese on an everything bagel. Paid for 2 eggs and only got 1 and the bagel is dry. Went in just last week, ordered the same thing, eggs were well done. Consistency in this place lately is very disappointing. We heard a lot of good things about Chifa, so we were really happy to get a last minute reservations on Saturday night for 4 people. I have to say we were disappointed and underwhelmed by our experience.\\n\\nThe food was non-inspiring. the portions were EXTREMELY small, and really pricey (both food and drinks). The civiche was good, but for 4 tiny THIN pieces at $19 - A RIP off. The best thing on the menu that I managed to have was Pulpo (grilled octopus)- which was one of the best ones I\\'ve had.\\n\\nThe decor is supposed to represent the fusion of Latin and Asian cousine, but instead looks like a former low-scale Chinese restaurant painted in bright \"Latin\" colors in a hurry. No further thought was given to ambience or style (all those little details that make Steven Starr\\'s restaurants so special). The restaurant is also very noisy.\\n\\nService was not that great either. While our wait staff was decent, it looks like the bus staff was instructed to wipe everything off the table to get us out the door immidiately. One guy was literally trying to grab half-empty plates from under us, as soon as we lifted the forks. He actually managed to grab couple of them succesfully.\\n\\nOverall - not recommending it and will not be coming back (especially with so many other options in the city). Looking for a new restaurant this weekend, we stumbled upon Cask and decided to give it a try.  When we walked in at 730pm on a Saturday night we were floored to see it basically empty on what should be a busy night.  We sat in the bar area.  My husband ordered the burger medium...it came out well done and dry. Fries were pretty good though.  I had the Fattoush salad...it was ok.  Wine and beer were decent.  \\n\\nOverall, we were unimpressed and probably won\\'t be going back.  You can tell they put a lot of money into this place, which is upsetting for them....doesn\\'t like the owners will be making back their investment.  I\\'m further turned off by the other bad reviews on here as well. my second foray into greek lady wasn\\'t as tasty. yes, i received a mountain of food, but it was a mountain of mediocre food. i ordered a salad with roasted red peppers and gyro and a side of the lemon roasted potatoes because they were so good the last time i ordered them. \\n\\nthe salad was enormous, but it was mostly iceberg lettuce, a few slices of cucumber, and a couple of tomato wedges. i shouldn\\'t have ordered the red peppers (though they made my salad slightly more nutritious) bc i got so much less gyro. \\n\\nthe lemon roasted potatoes must have been scraped out of the previous day\\'s roasting pan because they were soggy...and broken down to almost have qualified as mashed potatoes. they were entirely too salty and did not live up to either being \"lemon\" or \"roasted.\" Had a reservation to Fish for tonight. Was very excited. Had heard mixed reviews but figured it was worth a try. Showed up on the dot and fish was closed...on a Saturday night, due to flooding!  While I understand that restaurants cannot operate when unforeseen circumstances force them to shut down, a phone call to all reservations should have been common courtesy but we never received one. Unbelievably unprofessional. I will NEVER...EVER go back to Fish and neither should you. This is now called Siam Express and it is definitely an express trip to the bathroom. The food is prepared quickly but is floating in oil and my husband\\'s and my stomach are now suffering the after effects. Terrible. In Pinwei, you can be left along by all servers and staff for more than half an hour. The worst experience that I have ever had in any restaurant definitely when they only gave me a bowl of rice and nothing else, and left me at my table waiting for any dishes for 45 minute!!! A plain bowl of cold and worst quality rice can be what you only have on your table after you place your order for multiple dishes 45 minutes ago!!! \\n\\nAlso, the server in Pinwei are rude and inconsiderate. They were standing by our table, watching us when we were deciding how much tip should we give. I really do not like being stared when giving tips!!!\\n\\nNever go to this place! If you want some Chinese food, those restaurants in Philadelphia Chinatown are much better and much more authentic! And with BETTER SERVICE!!!\\n\\nI will never go to Pinwei again, unless I happen to want only plain rice for my dinner. Wow. Just.... Wow.\\n\\nI have never seen a more hectic, less well-run restaurant in my life. Today was my second trip in. They forgot part of my order, forgot to tell the kitchen they forgot part of my order (I reminded them after 5 minutes of standing there), and then when I got back to the office to eat my order I discovered they gave me the wrong thing (and the worst thing is, it was pork which i don\\'t eat)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the food is pretty damn good, so I\\'m conflicted.\\n\\nBut seriously, they are SEVERELY understaffed. That is definitely the biggest issue. I\\'d say number two is how unpleasant the kitchen looks. It is one of the most open-concept food prep areas I\\'ve ever seen, and it is a total mess. Food, seasonings, containers and utensils strewn all over the place, old, falling apart low-boy fridges (even though it just opened...?) and just a general air of chaos. I saw corn on the cob sit out in a to-go container with no lid for 10 minutes. Where was this corn going? Did it ever get there? Sadly I\\'ll never know.\\n\\nIn the 15-20 minutes it took me to get my food, I saw multiple people complaining about even longer waits. What makes this especially frustrating is that the portions are pretty tiny. The portions are not unfair, per se, for center city and the price, but i don\\'t want to wait 15 minutes to get food that will take me 5 minutes to eat.\\n\\nI really really hope this place gets their act together and succeeds because the food is good, but I have rarely if ever seen a restaurant run in a more haphazard manner. Odds of survival are not good. In the process of eating here on 2/3/17. Arrived at 6:45 with a reservation and still had  to wait to be seated. Had the Saucy Shrimp (quite good) and a Caesar Salad but entree did not arrive til after 7:45. Ordered the Longfin Tilapia and the shrimp in the topping were cold, like refrigerator cold. Hope they cooked them and from texture guessed they did. Manager removed them from bill without protest. I watched the last game of the World Series (part two) at this place, where the beers are cheap, but the selection is extremely limited and it\\'s downright dirty. I saw the bartender take a pint glass off the bar, dump out the contents, refill it with another beer, and serve it to another customer. I\\'m not even kidding. It was smoky in there, too, which I wasn\\'t a huge fan of. I guess since it doesn\\'t serve food, people can still smoke cigarettes. Either way, this place was pretty disgusting, and I doubt I\\'ll come here again. If you decide to go to this place, get bottled beer only! Building was run down. Rice was undercooked. There was only 1 bottle of hot sauce out. Date 2-22-14 We pay $18.00  plus a tip to park, Wait in line for 45 minutes to get in and you cant walk in the place.  The as advertised \"STATE OF THE ART VENTILATION SYSTEM\" does not work it is worthless.   I love the smell of a good cigar but the place reeks.  Maybe it works if there is 5 people in there but other than that  W-O-R-T-H-L-E-S-S.   Then we wiggle our way to the back to the humidor, grab some Padron 80 yr  at 40 bucks a piece.  While standing shoulder to shoulder for another 30 minutes for a place for the six of us to sit down, a couch finally opens up and my wife and i , and our friends sit down  the waitress comes over and says it is a 3   THREE hour wait to sit on that couch. We haven\\'t even had a chance to order a drink at this point.  I say, I JUST SPENT $40.00 per cigar and i cant sit on this couch?  No is the answer.  I am a WEEKLY customer of HOLTS, I go to the Northeast location once a week for the past 6 years  .I plan to call and talk to a manager Monday morning,  I will update this post after that conversation.  If this situation is not resolved I will never return again,  and i will let everyone i know that patronizes HOLTS the experience i had there.  I would give this place ZERO stars if I could.  If you are a hipster and want to try to be cool go here.  If you like to smoke cigars in a relaxing environment go some where else.   1210 am talk radio touts this as a cigar aficionados paradise but it is anything but that. Don\\'t waste your time\\n\\nP.S. I didn\\'t  get a chance to smoke my $40.00 cigar Usually the food is good and service is quick. I don\\'t know if there is a new owner but there was 1 waitress, no busboys and the hostess was pleasant but slow. Ordering took over 30 minutes and the food took longer. The food was both cold and did not taste good. I hope this is not the new norm but it will be a long time before we go back. Horrible food, long wait times, great service. Disappointment isn\\'t the word. Thought the atmosphere was great on the deck, our server was wonderful. Nachos sucked, wings were rock solid, cheesesteak was okay. Don\\'t go here. For Garces\\' flagship restaurant, this was definitely a disappointment. We ordered seven dishes, plus the olive oil ice cream for dessert.  Starting with the good ones, the Iberico pluma was excellent, and the octopus and the mussels were pretty good (except there were a lot of olives that made it too salty). The black cod was cooked to perfection, but it should have been served with chunks of hearty stewed tomato instead of the textureless, \"modernist\" tomato puree that tastes like canned soup, totally devoid of character. The artichoke and mushroom flatbread was worse than any Trader Joe\\'s frozen flatbread. The few pieces of mushrooms were lost in the sea of manchego, and although I love fat in food, this dish was too greasy even with the tangy artichoke slices doing damage control. The black truffles were barely detectable, but I get it, it\\'s an expensive ingredient. Moving on, the flash fried peppers did not quite come together with the salbitxada. The olive oil ice cream was great, but why pair it with chocolate ice cream, caramel, and cherries? The delicate flavor of the olive oil was overwhelmed by the other additions. Lastly, I had problem with the use of the same damn microgreens on most dishes as garnish. It was a rather annoying and lazy way to be trendy, as the greens did not complement many of the dishes. They were even in the olive oil ice cream, all I can say is \"huh?\". Now, if the ice cream had a bit of fresh rosemary or tarragon as garnish, it would have been great. Someone please put a bit more thought in designing the dishes. I wasn\\'t going to leave a review but everyone I talked to has had similar experiences at South Street. I believe it was the same seasoned staff, so that makes sense.\\n\\nSame good bagels as in South Philly. However, all the same troubles. Carve out a LOT of extra time in your morning if you plan to go. They make the bagels in seemingly random order, which caused me to be late. I asked that they toss mine in a bag, unfinished, and they were rude. They also told me that they had to make the orders for the people ahead of me (even though I was the one ahead of them). While making breakfast sandwiches, staff stared at the egg machine rather than completing a different order. When I finally got my bagel, it was cold, soggy and limp. Such a bummer and it happens probably 50% of the time I go to South St (maybe 4-6 times per year). If the everything bagels didn\\'t have salt, I wouldn\\'t go at all. Miso Glazed Cod drowned in the plate from too much sauce. Steak was bad. Appetizers were decent. Beer sample led me to believe it\\'s top notch brewery. The onl;y reason to visit this place is for the long term employees who were there before this current owner took over. The owner, by the way, has the personality of the \\'pet rock\\'. Food is below average. From the manager treating us rudely because we made an online reservation not knowing they were behind, the sticky table, the overpriced French martini only half filled and missing its raspberries to the disinterested server forgetting our appetizer...no need to ever go back. I don\\'t normally write reviews, but I couldn\\'t ignore this one. I ordered the green tea lychee froth and it was really gross. The froth was clumpy, not smooth or creamy at all. My friend ordered the famous Very Mango and they were really stingy with the fresh cut mango toppings. Lastly, we ordered the cold grass jelly and the grass jelly was not smooth either, very clumpy. Went in with high hopes but came out not satisfied! Won\\'t be a returning customer. Only reason why I give two stars instead of one is because at least the servers were friendly. Unfortunately service was incredibly slow.  Waited over 45 min and pizzas arrived half burnt. Waitress told us they could only cook 3 at a time. While waiting we were not even asked if we needed drink refills. Additionally, the plates we were given came out dirty with food residue still on them. Music was too loud and waitress could not hear us. Will not return.   Too many issues with service, management and kitchen. So dissapointed of this place! First of all the prices for the their extra small portions are definitely not worthe it! We came here as a group of 6, 4 adults and 2 kids (all were very hungry). We got a pizza that was on special and a salad on their special as well. I know the pizza\\'s here are all the same size but it\\'s no where near worthe $17. And the salad was a kids size that was $14. It had a half of avacadao in it, 2 pieces of tomato and some ricotta cheese. Ridiculous! Other people at the table ordered the same pasta dish but different size portions. Full size that was $19 was maybe 2 sizes of a kids size and super small as well. Both pasta dishes were under cooked and raw. The tomato sauce was just the sauce they use on pizza\\'s, how creative. Anyways my whole point here is if you want to make your money worthe to get some normal size portions and actually enjoy your meal, do not go here!! We spend around $90 for our group and all left hungry! Totally overpriced and hyped. The 1/2 off lobster deal is good, but the food wasn\\'t anything special. Overpriced to begin with. Mediocre seafood. Well. First off, it took us 5 minutes to be seated because there was no host, even though there was clearly no one in the restaurant. Second off, my \"Sprite\" I ordered, was no more than carbonated water. Last and foremost, our waiter somehow expected us to eat with our fingers and lick them clean after, after he forgot napkins and utensils. In conclusion, it sucked. The tea is actually very good I\\'ve only tried a few though and they were delicious enough to have me come back but I must say the customer service sucks! I don\\'t even want to go back but their drinks are so good. The girls are miserable and have attitudes they don\\'t smile and aren\\'t friendly at all. The girl today took someone who came to order after me clearly seeing I was ready to order and was there first. Last time I had questions and they seemed so annoyed and bothered so one of the customers who was clearly a friend of the girl behind the counter seemed annoyed that I interrupted her conversation and said loudly here\\'s the menu and slid me a menu. I still had questions but just wanted to get my tea and leave. I probably won\\'t be going back. For so much hype and advertisement - this indian food does not stand up.  The food is of typical flavor - all curry items tasted same and most of items on menu are not available most of the time.\\n\\nThe saving grace at this place could be biryani but I had much better.\\nMy recommendation there is grocery store next to restaurant - buy some groceries and make something you like at home.\\n\\nNot recommended ! Short review... food and service was great!  But, I wanted to take home a few things & the server we had just took the dishes I had away without saying anything... my fiancée mother had A BITE of the onion soup & he took it away without saying a word when I wanted to take it home. STAY AWAY! The food was good, but took forever. I witnessed one of the owners yell at a hardworking employee, in an unnecessarily mean way. Huge turnoff when the employer mistreats the employee like that! Very FAKE! I wouldn\\'t recommend Branzino if your a person of principals. Really didn\\'t like how the employees were being treated. As someone who has been in this business for over 30 years, I know first-hand, you should treat your employees with respect. This place obviously doesn\\'t think that\\'s too important, and for that reason, I won\\'t be back. Tonight we tried something new, instead of our usual place - Dimeo\\'s Pizza Kitchen.  After reading the reviews, we thought we should still give it a shot bc of the menu.  The menu looks great.  However, the food was mediocre.  Edible just not good.  Pasta was over-cooked, almost mushy.  The meatballs were bland, and calamari tasted like it was frozen.  It was also really expensive!  Not sure why the prices are so high.  We will stick with Dimeo\\'s. Walked in on 5-1-19 around lunch time and hostess looked miserable, they forgot my martini and had to be reminded, forgot our appetizer and had to be reminded, forgot to give us napkins and had to be reminded, and doubled charged for a soda....and it wasn\\'t even busy.  I always give this place the benefit of the doubt and always walk out disappointed.  Food is \"ok\" but the forgetfulness of the staff that day was annoying. Service And Food were incredibly disappointing. Service was horrible. It was like an amateur cook trying to cook Korean. We could not finish our food or the table next to us. Never coming back. Ever. I was disappointed in my trip here for apple picking. To be fair, it was a day or two after their big apple picking festival so that probably played a part in it. \\n\\nWhen we got out to the fields that were currently marked for picking we had alot of trouble finding good apples. Many were worm eaten or damaged and there was a ton of stinking rotten apples all over the ground. This attracted swarms of fruit flies and many bees. I\\'ve had terrible luck with bee stings this summer so I was more than a little afraid of going anywhere near most of the trees. \\n\\nIt took us an hour to fill up a small 1/2 peck bag and in the end the $10 it cost us was far more than I would pay at my local produce shop and the experience of the picking was...not fun. Even my 7 year old was happy to just be done with it.\\n\\nOn the plus side, and the reason I was willing to even give 2 stars: their donuts were great and we bought some pretty good cider too. I wish they were a bit closer so I could shop their market more often ( they had all kinds of jams,sauce,bakery items) but I doubt I\\'ll ever go apple picking there again. The coffee at the Coffee Station was weak and refills of coffee and soda weren\\'t free. We ended up paying $15 for beverages alone. My bacon egg and cheese sandwich was skimpy. For the price, you should be getting a great meal and you will not. I\\'m surprised how crowded it was. Do people have money to burn?\\nThe waitress we had has been there since it opened, but she seemed like she had no idea what was going on, like we stumped her when we asked for hot cocoa. We will not be going back. We ordered from here tonight.  The food was good but the delivery guy was horrible.  He delivered the order at 9:20.  I asked him if he had the chips.  He forgot them.  He said he would be right back.  He never came back until 10:00.  We had called them about 5 times or so.  When he came back he asked how many times we had called.  When I told him that it\\'s been an half hour he said that it wasn\\'t that long.  He thinks somebody doesn\\'t know how to tell time. We love Arpeggio and go as often as we can- and have for the past 15 years. Tonight, my husband and I went for dinner and sat outside. There was only one waitress outside- and she was clearly working her tail off. Unfortunately, it seems as though our dinners were forgotten and therefore we were seated for over 1.5 hours. Same with the people next to us. No offer of anything other than more pita for our hummus, just several apologies. The people next to us did get offered dessert on the house. Quite disappointed as they should know it would be hopping on a beautiful Saturday night. Hopefully they will add another waitress to their weekends so that this doesn\\'t happen throughout the summer.  Dinner was outstanding as usual, but service was lacking. Incredibly bad Philly cheese steak- low quality meat, dry and plain! It\\'s also overprice. Irony any Philly cheese steaks in Chicago or NYC are better than this place. yuck. \\none bite rice\\none bite beans\\nnext bite salsa\\nlast bite all flour wrap\\nburritos aren\\'t supposed to be deconstructed, you assholes. Dry crusty old food. \\nPenrose has the hardest French Toast in philly. \\nI did not enjoy it. \\nYesterday I had the roasted chicken and it was Ass. \\nThere is nothing special about this Diner. \\nYou can get everything here somewhere else and cheaper. \\nI\\'m still trying to wrap my head around the $8 GOD AWFUL French Toast. Burnt and dry. Wtf?\\n\\nThis has high reviews mainly from the knuckleheads that live in South Philly and have never eaten anywhere else. \\n\\nSave your money and stay on the highway until you are in Center city. There you can eat like a king. \\n \\nI will not be going back. I am so conflicted.\\n\\nWe were refused a reservation for a party under 5. Then we stood and waited by the bar for over 2 hours, watching walk ins that came in after us get sat and served. After the first hour and a half they dropped off some free deviled eggs which were great but only made us all hungrier. The hostesses here were really not very accommodating or attentive. Real talk they were kind of bitchy. \\n\\nThen after over 2 hours of waiting they sat us in a row at a counter. 4 people unable to have conversation over dinner. The kicker was the empty four top directly behind us.\\n\\nAll of that aside, our server was actually really friendly and allowed us to slide down the counter to an area that we could face each other and talk. \\n\\nThe food which at this point was kind of an afterthought as we were getting hangry. Our nice server are the only reasons i gave a 3 star rating. Hostesses deserve a 0. My husband just brought home a pulled pork sandwich along with a side of chili. The pulled pork sandwich was greasy and it tasted like they added yellow mustard to the BBQ sauce. The sandwich also came with stale tortilla chips. The chili was bland and just full hamburger meat NO PORK. We were suppose to get a side of cole slaw. We didn\\'t. I\\'ve tasted quite a few BBQ joints in the area and this is by far one of the worst. The food was good, but the server - Michael? It was comical. I can\\'t be certain of course, but he seemed high as a kite. We was so zoned out and forgetful. Really hope he didn\\'t drive home. Felt sorry for him and left 20% anyway :( Please, management, watch out for your servers? My experiences as this Chick-Fil-A location have always been positive.  The staff is friendly, and my food always comes out quickly.  But my visit yesterday left something to be desired.  \\n\\nMaybe it was because I had come during the height of lunch hour, and everyone was stressed and busy.  I hope that was the reason.  No problems with the speed of my food\\'s arrival or the quality of it.  What gives me pause for concern was what happened in the dining room.  There was a lady working the floor clearing trays from customers\\' tables and refilling their drinks.  This must be something new, I thought, or perhaps I had just never seen it until then.  \\n\\nShe asked me if I wanted my drink refilled, and I said yes.  I was impressed at the level of service for a fast-food restaurant.  Then she condescendingly told me to take the lid off my cup.  Okay, if it skeeves you to come into contact with the straw that was in my mouth, why are you offering to refill my drink in the first place?  I don\\'t know, there was something in her tone implying that I should have known to take the lid off in the first place.  So I took off the lid, handed her the cup, and questioned myself: Did I look dirty or unkempt? I am meticulously and scrupulously clean, and it really peeves me when sometime thinks I\\'m dirty.\\n\\nAt the end of my meal, I got up to throw away my trash, and one of the employees got annoyed with me because I made the mistake of standing next to the trash can, where the high chair she was dragging was meant to go.  Well, sorry...\\n\\nLet me end my review on a positive note and say that I\\'m impressed that Chick-Fil-A offers fruit salad as a healthy dessert option.  And it\\'s really good fruit salad that\\'s not 75% cantaloupe (in fact, there\\'s no cantaloupe at all), as some fruit salads are. The bouncer is a douche bag. Took away my real ID and went on to claim it was fake! He then went on to say I could get it back for $20. All I had was $10 so I gave him that and got my ID back. The place looked very dead for a Saturday night. You guys lost a lot of business especially since we were in a group of 10. Sometimes you revisit a restaurant you\\'ve been often and can just sense it\\'s imminent demise. I recently stopped into the Paoli Diner for breakfast and I was left with the impression that its days are numbered.\\n\\nThis was never a place I\\'d go to for anything but breakfast. An opinion several reviewers appear to share. \\n\\nBut on my recent trip-even breakfast was horrible. I mean really, pancakes with caramel (i.e. high fructose corn syrup faux caramel) ice-cream topping and bananas as a new menu item? My two eggs seemed to have been harvested from a severely anemic chicken, the home fries dusty dry. I mean, how can you make eggs and home fries taste bad? Well the cooks at Paoli Diner have figured out a way. \\n\\nOn Sunday, this place used to be hopping. But during my Sun. AM visit there, you could have heard the crickets chirping. Should be out of business very soon. Simply being Greek doesn\\'t guarantee a successful diner! Food is good and I am a repeat customer, but my last visit left me very unhappy.  The waiter slipped and dumped an entire glass of red wine all over my wool jacket and pants.  As the glass fell it hit the fork and it went right into my eye.  I ran into the bathroom trying to recoup and came back to the table completely soaked and sore. My eye was swollen.  Now, accidents happen, but no one came to say \"how are you\" or maybe give our party a round of drinks for the inconvenience or even have the manager come over to see if they could offer to pay for drycleaning.  Nothing.  Not a word.  Thought that was pretty lame.  I wrote them an email when I got home, but they never responded.  Customer service needs some work. We sat at the bar staffed with two bar tenders. It wasn\\'t packed. BOTH of them within 5 feet of us did not once greet us or even look at us. The one bar tender was even cleaning the bar surface in front of us from the previous couple and STILL didn\\'t even extend a, \"Hey- how\\'s it going?\"\\n\\nRUDE! After being ignored for 5 minutes- we left. The place had a nice atmosphere and the food was hot when it got to us, that\\'s all the positive things I have to say. They have their own soda and I tried their Cola, which tasted like it has something like rosemary added to it, it wasn\\'t great. Our food took 30-45 minutes to get to our table. One person\\'s chicken was burnt, while the Beef on Weck was mediocre. Some asked for no pickles, which are automatically added, and half the food was on top of the pickles. The waitress was incredulous as to why the pickles were a problem if the person was not allergic to them. If you want quick service, accurate orders, and friendly staff, go somewhere else. I was extremely disappointed with the quality of service and \"drinks\" they tried to serve us. I went there with a couple of friends last night to try and enjoy a few drinks and the bartender literally poured a sip when trying to serve us our shots! I\\'ve seen half shots poured before but to literally give us the amount they did was highway robbery($8 each..)! If you don\\'t have enough of something just tell us instead of trying to make it work when it clearly doesn\\'t. The picture is what I took prior to drinking it.... Will never be coming back here again. Ripoff! I was in at lunch time on Wednesday and got a lunch special.  The food was tolerable, but not worth a second visit.  The main dish was served as chicken teriyaki, but the chicken had not been marinated in teriyaki sauce or cooked in teriyaki sauce.  It had been boiled or steamed, and then dressed in teriyaki sauce at the last moment.  It was bland and uninteresting.\\n\\nThe salad had not been properly dried, and left behind an unpleasant little lake in my bento.\\n\\nThe lunch also included one fried pork dumpling, two pieces of tempura, three small pieces of California roll, and rice.  The tempura fry oil was very slightly too old, but I think most people would not have noticed; I am unusually sensitive to rancid oil.\\n\\nPrice for the lunch box was $7.99 plus tax and tip.  Service was good.\\n\\nI also got two pieces of yellowtail sushi.  This was a grave mistake.  To justify obscene prices, sushi must be exquisite.  My $6 got me two tiny pieces of inexpertly-prepared sushi.  The fish was of poor quality.  Perhaps it had been frozen?  And the sushi fell apart.  Charging $6 for this dish required tremendous effrontery.\\n\\nI see no reason to come back. I was visiting from out of town and was looking forward to eating here. Friday night 7:30pm and the place was closed. There was no signage, no message on phone. Not sure if they closed permanently. If I wanted to pay a ridiculous amount of money for a beer and a brat, I\\'d take the trip to Munich.  \\n\\nThe prices in this place rival any average bar in New York City.  Expect to pay upwards to $40 for a couple of beers and a brat here.  \\n\\nAnd if the owner ever takes a look at this, you\\'re on South Street in Philadelphia.  I can get $2 tacos and pierogis a block down the street.  No wonder every time I go in there it\\'s only about 1/4 full. TLDR: One of the worst service experiences I\\'ve had in about a decade.\\n\\nThe details: My friends and I arrived about 15 minutes after they opened, and were told we\\'d have to wait for drinks because there wasn\\'t a bartender yet. Not a huge deal...we\\'re having a good time with each other. We finally get drinks about 15 minutes later, and we request some songs. \\n\\nThat was the last time we saw the bartender for over a half hour. Despite the fact that there were only 4-8 more people there at all times, we had to wait about a half hour for each drink refill, and when we asked for cards to request songs, she actually ignored us. I asked her 20 minutes later for more cards again, and she was openly hostile while finally getting us cards and putting in our songs (openly saying \"Oh my god\" while we were singing). In fact, while her paying customers were waiting to be served, she decided to sing two songs herself...ignoring everyone else at the bar. When we decided to go because she was obviously making our fun day out into a nasty experience, she openly ignored our repeated requests several times...we finally had to shout at her to get her to acknowldge us...and she was literally about two feet away. We finally left and went to Yakitori Boy, where we should have gone in the first place, and had a great time.\\n\\nThat as my first and last experience with Tango...just don\\'t bother. I dined at this restaurant for Father\\'s Day 2018. I made 6pm reservation, they did not seat me until 6:50. I then waited for over 15-20 mins for my drink order to be taken and then another 15-20 mins after that for my dinner order to be taken. The chef then came over to our table to cook. He was putting on his show and lit the grill on fire (normal Hibachi trick) and the fire was so large it came off of the grill, melted the straws to the drink cups and set the napkins on fire. At this point I should have left. Orders on the table were messed up or missing. My boyfriend\\'s salmon was dropped while chef placed it on his plate. Vegetables were dropped into my water cup while chef was placing them on my place. Drink was not refilled for roughly 15 mins. The food was hard to enjoy due to the terrible service. Unfortunately I don\\'t know what the food from Pizzeria Pesto tastes like. After 1hr 25 mins waiting for my delivery on a week day I called to cancel my order. That\\'s just terrible customer service. Don\\'t get the appeal. The gelato is quite watery. Fior di latte is too sweet and pineapple sage is too heavy on sage and too light on pineapple. I am so upset. We ordered a pizza and fries from here once before and it was good, so I suggested to our guests we order from here.\\n\\nFirst, ordering was a huge process. Apparently it\\'s the old menu online. So many items I requested weren\\'t available. Unfortunately, someone wanted anything but marinara/red sauce. Apparently, that\\'s all they offer - no alfredo, no rosa. Everything I tried to order, the girl did not understand. She had to talk to someone in the background to see if the made it, and it was nothing but difficult. \\n\\nHere\\'s the disappointing part: an hour later when the food showed up two items were missing and two were wrong! I then called to get a refund to my card for the missing items. I got CJ\\'s fries which comes with a delicious seasoning usually. Instead I got a mushy pile of thick cut fries with mozerella. The wings we got had the wrong sauce on them. I had high hopes for the pizza we got, but it was cold. Lastly, the chicken parm was a cold block of cheese with a piece of chicken.\\n\\nI am not exaggerating when I say I legitimately wasted $50.00. I am now standing here cooking dinner. Terrible establishment. 45 minutes later after we ordered... Food has not arrived. I am in the process of leaving. This place needs to hire more people. Do not come during busy lunch hours. Went to Talk for brunch. The menu was small but food was tasty. However, the service was quite disappointing. We showed up around 10:30 and place was mostly empty with only three tables occupied. The waitress was literally standing right in front of us going over the menu with a table but did not acknowledge us for what felt like a long time. We stood there awkwardly looking at her and empty tables wondering if we should just sit down? She then told us all the tables were reserved but we could sit by the bar if we want. We ordered two different quiches and savory eclairs. All were tasty but took a long time for the food to arrive despite an empty restaurant. A few more people showed up but plenty of tables remained empty while we were there. It\\'s a shame because the slow and lukewarm service makes it unlikely I\\'ll return. I came in a few hours ago with some friends for happy hour drinks & snacks. Our bartender, an older gentleman, was extremely kind and attentive throughout our dining experience. We ordered the lobster rolls, the salmon ceviche, and the firecracker cauliflower; all incredible dishes at an awesome price! I had the blueberry lemonade cocktail which was also amazing. Earlier in the night, our friend asked our bartender if it was possible to charge her phone behind the bar & our bartender kindly plugged in her phone.\\n\\nAfter paying, we asked a different bartender (long brown hair pulled back in a scrunchie) if we could have our phone/charger back. She rolled her eyes at us and walked away. She came back a few seconds later with the phone, however no charger. 10 minutes later, we notified the same bartender that we still had not received our charger. She rolled her eyes once again and said it was \"lost\" it behind the ice box and we have to wait for someone to come get it. We explained that our uber was outside and she snapped at our group \"there\\'s nothing I can do. It\\'s lost. Someone has to get it.\" She walked away.\\n\\nAll of the girls in our party work in the service industry and we know this is absolutely not how to talk to customers. We asked the rude bartender for her name and she ignored us. We asked her once again and she snapped \"its Elle.\" She then rushed away. A few minutes later, the kind older bartender finally brought over our phone charger. We asked him the name of the woman bartender who was so rude to us; he said her name is \\'Heather.\\' We were very pleased with our food/dining experience, but we were disgusted by how we were treated by Heather. Rooftop deck is cozy and makes for good people watching in one of the coolest parts of the city. Happy hour specials are a can\\'t miss ($4 for craft imports!), as are the pizzas. My only issue is with the service: while the servers are usually pretty efficient, they\\'re not always helpful -- in one instance (out of the 3 times I\\'ve been there), they refused to split a check for the table of 10 that I was sitting at. That said, I\\'m a pretty self-sufficient guy, so I don\\'t let stuff like that bother me too much. It certainly won\\'t keep me from coming back again. 25-30 minute wait for take out food. Really??  Poorly run and have no idea what\\'s even being cooked. Never again! I just have to come to terms with the fact that I really dislike the American-style brazilian steakhouse scenario.  With most buffets, the all-you-can-eat establishment\\'s fundamental philosophy is almost always the same - sacrifice quality for quantity.  Give \\'em lots and lots of meat, feed \\'em \\'til they\\'re ready to burst  and then, they shake \\'em down with the price of alcohol and voila! here\\'s your final bill!  Men with skewers, take a bow!\\n\\nI don\\'t like theater or antics with my food.  But Fogo (along with its other counterpart in the city, Chima) seems to rely on all these tricks and they succeed in bringing in a crowd every night. \\n\\nThe food simply does not deliver. The salad bar lacks any true variety and excitement (one point for the shitake mushrooms and the hearts of palm though).  It gets restocked continuously and is fresh, however it looks no better than what one would find at an Aramark run facility.  The meat variety and temperature options is acceptable, but except for one or two cuts of meat (i.e., the top sirloin), the quality and taste is lamentable.\\n\\nIf I ever come back here, it will be too soon. \\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, I love red meat -  but this place doesn\\'t deserve my carnivorous tendencies.  If you want to get stuffed on never-ending, endless below average meat* (no better than what YOU can cook at home- trust me), this is your jam.   Come for lunch instead of dinner and save a bundle.\\n\\n*this review could have been replete with double entendres and sexual innuendos, but I couldn\\'t be bothered. Having just been served the worst prime rib I\\'ve ever tried to eat.\\nThere was  so much gristle I cut it in baby bites and was able eat some.\\nI told waitress and she offered to bring another one, I stated that I didn\\'t want another one as it would probably be from the same slab of beef.\\nI thought she would ask floor manager to speak with me, but no, just got my check.\\nPaid and departed.\\nWon\\'t be going back anytime soon.\\nFYI, Texas Roadhouse was my favorite restaurant! Tonight was my birthday dinner at La Peg. I chose La Peg because I have been there 3x before this evening and very much enjoyed the food, service and ambiance. Tonight was a different story. It was an extremely disappointing experience. There were 7 in our party and they squished us all on a table made for 6. I would not have minded if the place was busy but it wasn\\'t, at all. The server was blah, not unfriendly but seriously lacking in showing any personality or accommodation. Our drink order took FOREVER to receive and by the time we ordered appetizers we had been there for a half an hour. Our apps and main entree were good, no complaints about the food. My fiancé told the waitress privately that it was my birthday and asked if she could she put a candle in a dessert when it was time to deliver it. What I got was a plate with the words, Happy Birthday, written in hardened chocolate  syrup...there was nothing else on the plate. I ordered the Jewish apple cake as my dessert, why couldn\\'t they write happy birthday on the plate with the dessert or put a candle in the cake? What are you supposed to do with hardened chocolate on a plate? \\nOverall, it was just a very unwelcoming experience with not a care by the staff for being timely with taking our order or making a birthday special. The place was empty so it\\'s not like there were loads of people to attend to. Won\\'t be back and will not be recommending La Peg to anyone anymore. I used to love this place but feel that it\\'s gone downhill in the last year or so. The food even seems rather meh. They took off the caprese panini -super disappointed that was my go to everytime. The baked Brie appetizer is gone as well. The new menu is very hard to navigate it\\'s organized haphazardly. Last time I got sweet potato fries here they were quite.. Moist? The wait for food always seems forever. Maybe seven times of out ten we\\'re left waiting for a waitress to find us and acknowledge us. We\\'ve organized large groups here before with no problem but I think in the future we\\'ll organize events somewhere new. The food wasnt very vibrant, as I imagined it would be. I waited a long time to try vietnamese, and I was disappointed I guess. My seafood dish was a soup of brine. Couldnt taste much of it. I dont think I would go again, maybe if someone recommended it very intensely. Great venue/beer selection BUT...the worst bar service ive had in the whole of the u.s. The bar tender was more interested in talking to her friend about her tattoos than serving us. We waited for 5 minutes at the bar to pay our bill but she still ignored us so we left the money and bill on the bar and started to walk out. As soon as she saw us walking off she screamed at us asking for the money. Everyone sitting at the bar turned and stared at us like we had done something wrong. We explained that the money was on the bar and she just turned and walked off.\\n\\nThe venue has alot of potential but with service like that im surprised anyone goes there. If it was possible to put 0 stars i would. AVOID Awfull service and food. Never again, better buy some frozen food and stay at home. Really dirty tables and forks, byob vodka to disinfect Bartender Gabby? Gabriel? Was the absolute worst. I told her it was my first time here gave me a menu and chatted up with some other dude throwing back shots at 3 in the afternoon (not that there\\'s anything wrong with that). I ordered the jalapeño margarita, it was ok. Ordered $20 tacos. The salmon was great but the rice was a brick and undercooked. She was very attentive to the guy as well as two women that were regulars. Always checked up on them, but I finished my margarita a good while before my food came out never asked did I want another drink. I don\\'t think I would be making such a big deal if it were actually busy, but there were only four of us at the bar. She even took the time to share her homemade spaghetti sauce recipes and Google \"date night\" spots for her and her boyfriend later on that evening with the other guests. I am new to the mainline area and I\\'ve been pretty satisfied with a lot of restaurants and bars but this is not one of them. Save your money or go to Besito for good margaritas and amazing service. REAL ZEN SEEKERS BEWARE! NOT ZEN, JUST A CATCHY NAME!!!! Self absorbed manager stood outside smoking and speaking profanities. Lack luster service at the counter...the \"zenrista\" stood chatting to friends lending no attention to the paying customers! \\n\\nTHE WORST: THE TEA WAS STALE!\\n\\nI would like to start by saying I have traveled to many places, I have been to many \"real\" zen tea shops. I wrote this review the day after I visited your shop. The gentleman behind the counter who still works there, not a past employee. The owner was on the phone cursing and talking about how she was about to buy a new house, that she was so much better then most people, and I thought I was attending a zen place! This was my first time in the area, let alone the store. I did not know of previous ownership as alleged by other reviews. The reason my post gets on Yelp is because I speak the truth of what I experience. That was the worst $8 for tea and cookie I have spent. After leaving my wife said we were better off going to Starbucks for a cup of their tea. I\\'m really sorry if the truth hurts.\\n\\nYou cannot tread the path until you have become the path yourself, some real zen for your shop. Says they are open til 2am, but closed before, got. no tacos tonight :-/ . Outdoor patio lighting was cute and lit Reen\\'s has defiantly gone downhill. You can only live on a name and reputation for so long. I don\\'t know how people still order from here. The place is filthy dirty. I walked in today to order and almost walked out. I should have. I ordered and American hoagie and had a nice long hair in it. It had to be a good 6 inches. Disgusting! Never again.. Okay, I will preface this by saying I had a very unique experience. \\n\\nMy girl and I were in Philly and decided to check this place out regardless of the terrible reviews.\\n\\nWe were greeted by an unexcited bouncer, fine. Not uncommon at clubs, understandable. Our bartender was nice, but inattentive. There were about six other people in the bar, it was very early. We got our beers, paid $7.50 which was reasonable for Blue Moon.  On my second sip the bottom of the glass breaks and spills beers all over me. I\\'m talkin\\' pants soaking wet, my chest, it seeped into my shoes. The bartender took the broken glass away and wiped the wet bar. We asked for a towel as I stood covered in beer. I finally got a dirty bar towel the size of a wash cloth.  She walked away to explain to the bouncer this freak accident. I asked again if I could have more towels, I admittedly grew infuriated as I waited. The bus boy took them to the bartender (instead of me) and I had to walk halfway around the bar to get them as she didn\\'t bring them to me.  Meanwhile, no replacement beer, no apology, no shot that says dude, sorry you have to walk two miles back to your hotel covered in beer. \\n\\nI understand that this was an isolated freak incident that no one could have predicted, however their response - or lack of one - was really despicable.  You couldn\\'t even replace the drink that I paid for?  A glass broke in my hand with no provocation, that is the least one can do.\\n\\nI asked for my money back, which they at least gave me.  Being in the business of customer service, I am hyper aware, perhaps I need to lower my standards. Terrible! I had the general tso chicken with vegetable fried rice- pretty basic... However, it was so inedible that I threw it away after about 3 painful bites.. Best thing on the menu is their Snapple! Wish I would have seen some of these reviews before i spent my 7 bucks. Sloppy pork fried rice in my sweet and sour chicken combination dinner, and they forgot my sweet and sour sauce on delivery.  First time trying cj wok, and my last.  Dragon 2 is way better, they put care in what they serve to customers. I went to this place somewhat by accident before a concert.  I did not know that it was no longer JD McGillicuddy\\'s, and had purchased a voucher for there from restaurant.com.  Right off the bat, the experience was a disaster.  Initially, we had to seat ourselves, and after a few minutes, we made sure someone knew we were there.  A few minutes later, someone appearing to be a manager asked if we were being helped and took our drink order (Bud Light & Budweiser).  2 Bud Lights came about 10 minutes later along with our waitress.  Food order was placed and was not delivered for an hour.  The waitress checked once in the meantime, and took another beer order, which was again wrong.  She came back to see if we needed anything, and realized we did not have our food.  She apologized repeatedly, but still did not get us our food for another 15-20 minutes.  The food was passable, but the experience was unacceptable. Well if your looking for a place that treats their customers rude this is the place for you. I went in to pick up my take out order (I placed my order at 5:15 for 6:15) I walked in and gave my name and number. The women went to look for it she came back and said she didn\\'t have it. So she kept looking then began to help other customers. Then she began busing tables at that point I was sure I was on the show punked. After a few more min I asked someone else they went and got her. She asked me if I came up with another number. I informed her I knew my phone number and this mistake was on their part. Glad I got out of there without giving them any money. went here on cinco de mayo because every other place was packed. food was odd. shrimp quesadilla had shrimp fragments (not even sure if it was shrimp) , balsamic vinegar, sour cream, and cheese. who smothers a quesadilla with balsamic dressing? service was really slow and it wasnt that busy. bussers were more attentive than our server . the chorizo corn chowder was pretty good. probably wont return unless its a last resort. this has to be about the worst place i have ever been, i would tell you to make a better vegan hoagie, but you should just get rid of it and offer nothing vegan.  it is more insulting to charge somebody ten dollars for a roll with lettuce on it, than to just have nothing to offer them at all.  the service is unfriendly and the food is horrible.  the inside looks nice, but it was an overall cold experience.  see ya around never. Walked in and right out after saw the selection. No sashimi for $30? Overstuffed with rice sushi. Didn\\'t look too fresh either. Maybe it was one bad time, I don\\'t know.  My advice spend same amount in sushi bar and be sure it\\'s fresh. Burnt, careless roasts and *food poisoning* from the lox.\\n\\nChobani bought this company and they\\'re no longer the local staple / favorite the basic suburban people think they are. \\n\\nRecommending otherwise:\\n\\nReanimnator\\nThe Grhyphon\\nSteep & Grind 2 and a half stars.\\n\\ni\\'ve been going to this place since i was a child and wow how it\\'s changed every year for the worse....\\nthe quality of the food has fallen DRAMATICALLY.  the service has varied, when i went as a child, the servers were wonderfully polite. over the years, i had some bad experiences with the wait staff there.  now its just \"ok\".\\n\\nthe thing that kills me is the quality of the food.  used to be the best vietnamese place i could ever imagine.. now its just EHH.  last time i went, they didnt even give me basil with my pho and bun.  and the bean sprouts were old as hell.  \\n\\nALSO big problem here... they need to dust/clean big time... their floors and windows are FILTHY.  \\n\\ntoo bad you can\\'t get in a time machine, cos only then would i recommend this place. Not happy with the service!!!!!!! Waited all night for a hot glass of water.  They do not have ice.  The Kabob is beef and the waitress told me it was chicken.  I do not eat beef.  The waitress replaced my meal with the Falafel and charged me for two meals.\\nWhen I complained they said that I would need to speak with the manager.  I waited 20 minutes and the manager never came out to speak with me.  Will NEVER go back to this restaurant. My boyfriend and I were here just the other day and let me tell you, it was very interesting!!!!!!  First of all, we started out as the only patrons there, which should have been  a red flag,  We ordered and had our soup, which was fair......as we began eating our meal, another patron who came in and my bf both saw a shadow run across the floor!!  They both thought it might be a mouse, but weren\\'t really sure of what they had seen.  At that time, we told the waitress that we thought we saw a mouse and she didn\\'t seem very surprised.  A few minutes later, the mouse ran out into the middle of the restaurant and we were outta there!!!!!!!  Health bureau has been made aware and we are never going back.......You decide!!!!!!!!!! I am leaving this review on Yelp instead of a food ordering and delivery service which shall not be named but which has the initials GH... why? Because if the food never arrives you don\\'t get an opportunity to leave a review on GH. \\n\\nSo anyway - You know when you order food and you are really excited about it? Well, we just moved into a new place and are demo-ing it ahead of a full on renovation. So we basically live in one room while the rest of the rooms are in a state of complete chaos, plaster dust, and old insulation. (Read: no kitchen). It was Friday after a full day of construction work and we were hungry and tired. Tacos sounded like just the thing, and we were really excited for our meal to arrive! We ordered a big mess of food and then started waiting. One hour passed, but I figured \\'hey its Friday! Lots of people want tacos!\" We waited another hour. At 2 hours in, I called the restaurant but believe it or not, nobody answered. I finally called GH who refunded the $ after not being able to get a hold of anyone at the restaurant either. But it didnt matter, we had waited so long (and had quite a few of the beers we intended to drink with the tacos) that it was too late to get anything else. (I had a almost slimy banana and some pita chips for dinner, all that we had in our makeshift apartment). \\n\\nListen Revolution Taco! When people order take out, sometimes they dont have any other options and that food arriving means something. Dont accept orders you cannot fill. It pains me to say that this place has really deteriorated. I used to pick up an order from Tiffin and take it to work pretty regularly, and the chicken/paneer tikka masala, butter chicken, korma dishes, among other things were always spot on. They were always reliable - not too spicy, not too runny, just exactly what you were craving. But lately it\\'s been hit or miss.\\n\\nThe last time I went here, I got an order of paneer tikka masala and a flatbread. The sauce in my main dish was so thin and oily that I barely ate any of it. Same color, just not the consistency that you could pour over rice and eat with a fork. \\n\\nAnd then the flatbread. It was loaded with vegetables, which really had no seasoning on them, and the dough was completely uncooked. I pulled the pieces of broccoli and cauliflower out of the raw top of the flatbread, though the entire bottom was charred. Gross.\\n\\nI\\'m hoping this was just a fluke, but not at all optimistic about it. The prices also keep going up, and they\\'re getting borderline prohibitive. When you eat in, you get only about 2/3 of the food that you get for a take-out order.\\n\\nHey there, Ekta... Ordered their food through Grubhub last night because Sitar was closed and my boyfriend and I really wanted Indian food. They first brought me the entirely wrong order and then by the time I realized this, they had closed. The food they gave us was also cold and not cooked well. When I asked Grubhub for a refund from the restaurant, they refused, even though the food that we didn\\'t even order was expensive and cooked badly. I\\'ve had some amazing indian food in my lifetime from a best friend\\'s family home cooking and from solid indian restaurants, and this was just disappointing. I will not be ordering from here again. Don\\'t waste your money -- go to Sitar 2 blocks away instead. This review isn\\'t about the food, which is decent but overpriced, but rather about the terrible customer service. \\n\\nWe ordered for pick up through their online service and waited the suggested hour before coming to pick our food up. When we arrived, they hadn\\'t even started cooking our order and blamed it on their online system (even though they were able to pull up the order once we got there...).\\n\\nThey asked us to wait another 20 minutes, which I wouldn\\'t have minded if they had given us a beer or something to help right the mistake. Instead, we were charged full price, barely given an apology, and made to wait over an hour and a half for our food.\\n\\nI really hope Tiffin wises up to the way they should handle customers they have inconvenienced. I won\\'t be dining there again solely based on the incredible lack of customer service. This is not in any form or fashion a good Pizza Hut. I placed an order in the afternoon to be picked up in the evening. It was a stuffed crust pizza and they didn\\'t have any stuffed crust. Called me 10mins before I was scheduled to pick it up and told me. Then when I get there it\\'s not ready and on top of that they didn\\'t make it correctly so I had to wait for another pizza. The place was filthy, roach on the wall and employees weren\\'t washing there hands. Touching trash, there face and food. This one should\\'ve been closed instead of the other one in South Philly. I don\\'t know why they were closed but this one needs to be. Worst service in Philly hands down.  The food isn\\'t even that great. Do yourself a favor and go to the one kn Front Street. Service is better and food is decent. No AC. It is too hot here. And it takes so long to get your order. By the time your food arrives, you are exhausted. The cupcakes at Sweet Box, while pricey, are very good.  I have no problem paying extra for a quality product and often do, especially for food.  What I do have a problem with is supporting a business with bad service.  Doing so affirms this kind of behavior is okay.\\n\\nNormally, I would disregard a less than friendly interaction, but on each of the three times I have visited this place, I have been extremely turned off.  It\\'s really too bad because I enjoyed my cupcakes, and what is most unfortunate is the person guilty of the rudeness appears to be the owner, or at least in a managerial position.\\n\\nShe has:\\n- looked annoyed as I perused the options while staring at me impatiently (sorry, but not everyone has been staring at that display case all day too)\\n- never acknowledged my presence while walking into the tiny shop until I initiated the transaction (not even eye contact)\\n- always been immersed in a loud and annoying conversation that she is too unwilling to part from to serve\\n- made snappy comments to her employees that have made me a little uncomfortable\\n\\nIf you are so much better than to acknowledge a customer, I guess you must be doing really well yourself.  In that case, good for you, you don\\'t need my loyalty from the neighborhood anyway.\\n\\nI can\\'t give only one star because like I said, the product is delicious.  I want to be fair to this business and the review reader in admitting that.  However, I won\\'t be returning and will be looking to buy somewhere that values my support... or doesn\\'t look pissed that I\\'d like to order at least. This place might be good. I\\'ll never know.\\n\\nWe tried to stop in for my birthday at around 4:30 p.m., and were brusquely informed by the bartender that they were closing at 5 for a private party and that we should leave. When we stated that they never posted that information on their website, they snottily responded, \"Well, we posted it on Facebook.\"\\n\\nLook, I work in web content, and you never, EVER rely purely on social media for news and announcements. Especially with FB\\'s crazy algorithims, many people might never see it. You need to put stuff like that on your actual website. Otherwise, you do your customers--and yourselves--an incredible disservice.\\n\\nI still managed to have a fun birthday in spite of Manatawny\\'s smug incompetence. But they\\'ll never get a dime of my money, or the money of anyone else I know. Thanks for nothing. We go to Bonefishgrill a lot but there are always issues!! Salad has little dressing. Soup comes out lukewarm.\\nService is slow. Salmon is often undercooked! Very few shrimp dishes to pick from as entree. We never leave feeling good about our meal. It\\'s just convenient to where we live... I think they need to put more effort in the food prep!! I used to enjoy firebirds and the option of having fairly respectable new england clam chowder and tater tots but the service has become increasingly lazy and complacent from the hostesses to the manager.when you sit for almost 10 minutes in a fairly empty restaurant and Noone including the manager who is standing at the table next to yours chit chatting and walks away. I also wish I could say that this was the first time to have lack luster non existent service but it sadly is not. Yes that same manager had been alerted to it then but the issue persists and continues to grow worse. For the price point you can do way better. Steer clear. If you do decide to chance it be sure to check things including your napkin for cleanliness. Wayyyy too small !!! And always crowded in such a small space I don\\'t like this location . Horrible tight parking too Never been to the restaurant only order for take out. Food is typical Chinese food. PRICES on the menu provided are completely different from what they tell you over the phone. My order I saw online vs what they charged me was off by $7 after calling and explaining that they said the menu was outdated and it\\'s wrong. I also asked if they would refund me the money and they strongly refused. Not so happy with that. Actually pretty disappointed. Will not be ordering from there again. The man on the phone was very rude. My friend suggested Firebirds for dinner. Of course I immediately went to Yelp to read reviews. I should\\'ve listened to you Yelp. Now, they do have call ahead seating, which is fabulous. We waited less than 5 minutes for a table on a Friday night at 7pm after calling ahead. \\n\\nWe were promptly greeted by our server and I saw that their Flirtini had St. Germaine in it. I love anything with St. Germaine in it, so I ordered it. When it arrived, the glass was not very full. For a $9.50 martini, I\\'m not asking for a full to the brim glass, but I did feel like I got jipped a little bit. \\n\\nMy friend ordered the salmon, bf ordered the coconut shrimp, and I ordered the grill shrimp and strawberry salad. Our server said she would be back with bread. Bread never came. \\n\\nOur meals arrived and my salad portion was very large, but I quickly saw it was over dressed. I should\\'ve ordered the dressing on the side, my bad. I dove in and it was good. They did not skimp on the goat cheese. I tried bf\\'s coconut shrimp and while they had a nice flavor, they were soggy. Like they were sitting on the plate for a while. \\n\\nI didn\\'t feel that the prices were exceptionally high. $20 for the soggy coconut shrimp is a bit much, but if they were prepared and plated properly I could see charging $20. It also came with 2 sides. My salad was $14.50 and thought that was reasonable for the size and again they didn\\'t skimp on the goat cheese, nor the pecans, shrimp, or strawberries. \\n\\nI was disappointed in the martini, soggy shrimp, and the over dressed salad. The ambience is nice, but there were still a lot of families there on a Friday night. If I\\'m going to go somewhere on a Friday night for dinner, I want to go somewhere more suitable for adults versus families. We decided to have Thanksgiving dinner at this restaurant. Service was excellent. Food was absolutely horrible. The turkey was dry. The gravy tasted like wallpaper paste. There was absolutely no flavor to the entree. Very expensive for a lackluster meal! Can\\'t hold a candle to DeLorenzo\\'s tomato pies in Hamilton or Robbinsville, NJ. Not even in the same leaque. I ordered a chicken cheesesteak. The bread was not fresh and there was so little cheese they should be ashamed. Overall a dry stale sandwich. That is my first and last visit. didn\\'t have a good experience tonight. i tried to call a few times to order my food and was placed on hold for over five minutes. when i got there the service was a little better. McCafferty\\'s cold salads are really bad tasting. I\\'ve had potato salad, macaroni salad and tonight cole slaw. Really bland, tastes like tasteless mayonnaise and cabbage. When I bought their potato salad last year I brought my review to one of the servers. He said people don\\'t like spicy food so you can add your own flavoring! Really????? Come on McCafferty check your recipes!!!!! I went here for dinner last Tuesday around 8:40 pm. I wanted to go to Maya J, but unfortunately it was closed. My date and I walked into the restaurant and we were not greeted. The wait staff actually made eye contact with us, but still did not engage. We waited 5 minutes maybe even more before another patron suggested that we just have a seat. We started to take a seat when a male waiter walked over to us and informed us that the section we chose was closed. He told us that the restaurant will be closing soon and I asked him if they were open until 10? He responded with a yes and continued to say they will be closing up in an hour and a half and that we could have a seat at the bar (he did not offer us a table). We take a seat at the bar, and I will say that the bartender was very nice, greeted us and took our order right away. Maybe 15 minutes later a white couple walks in and are greeted immediately and are given a table to sit at and even received their food before we did! I am Black and my date Puerto Rican. This made me feel extremely angry, but I tried (and did) to stomach it and enjoy my date. The only reason I gave this place 2 stars was due to the attentive bartender. I won\\'t be going back.'"
